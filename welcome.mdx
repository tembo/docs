title: 'What is Tembo?'
---

**Tembo is your engineering agent – always watching, always working.** It can work from your existing tickets, find bugs, fix broken pipelines, and open PRs to improve your codebase through a variety of integrations – and it works from anywhere you are.

## What can Tembo do?

- **Fix production bugs** — Monitors error tracking tools like Sentry and automatically generate PRs to fix the errors.

- **Implement from issues** — Assign issues from Slack, Linear, Jira, etc. to Tembo and it writes code to solve the issue, whether it's a bug, a feature, or a refactor.

- **Reduce technical debt** — Periodic analysis of your codebase to identify technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and refactoring opportunities, then submits PRs for quick wins.

- **Write & update documentation** — Using your monorepo as the source, update your docs repo to ensure features are well-documented.

- **Run automated workflows** — Create custom [workflows and automations](/features/workflows) that execute on schedules or triggers to handle routine maintenance, generate reports, or respond to events.

All these are optional, but Tembo can do them all.

## What about my team?

Your team will review, approve, improve and merge PRs from anywhere. Whether you are using GitHub or GitLab, Tembo will work with you.

We have a [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) for reviewing Tembo's work from your source control provider. If you use AI-powered code review tools like Graphite, CodeRabbit, or Cursor Bug Bot, Tembo will validate and commit relevant changes if you enable this feature.

## Setting up integrations

Getting started with Tembo is straightforward - connect the tools your team already uses:

- **Source control** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for creating PRs
- **Issue tracking** (Linear, Jira, Github Issues) for ticket assignments
- **Productivity Tools** (Slack, Raycast) for ticketless work assignment
- **Monitoring** (Sentry) for automatic error detection
- **Databases** (PostgreSQL, Supabase, AWS RDS) for performance optimization

Most integrations use OAuth for secure connection. After authorization, Tembo syncs your data and you can activate the repositories or projects you want monitored. Once active, Tembo immediately starts scanning and can begin working on assigned issues or detected issues.
