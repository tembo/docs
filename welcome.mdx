title: 'What is Tembo?'
---

**Tembo is the automation layer for engineering teams.** It orchestrates signals from your tools into working code — connecting where work appears to where it gets done. Just tag Tembo in Slack, Linear, Jira, or let it watch your monitoring systems. Cloud-based and always on, Tembo helps you get more output from your existing team.

## How Tembo Works: Signals → Work

Tembo bridges the gap between where work appears and where it gets done:

- **Sentry spots an issue** → Tembo opens a PR
- **Someone drops a task in Slack** → Tembo handles it
- **A Linear ticket gets assigned** → Tembo starts working
- **A cron or monitoring alert triggers** → Tembo creates the fix

Instead of `alert → ticket → human → PR`, you get `alert → Tembo → PR`.

## Automate at the Task Layer

Every org has repetitive engineering work: bug fixes, dependency bumps, schema updates, alert-driven changes. Tembo automates these at the task layer so your team can focus on what matters:

- **Small teams** get speed and velocity
- **Large teams** get consistency and coverage across the org
- **All teams** reduce AI lethargy and increase adoption

## What about my team?

Your team will review, approve, improve and merge PRs from anywhere. Whether you are using GitHub or GitLab, Tembo will work with you.

We have a [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) for reviewing Tembo's work from your source control provider. If you use AI-powered code review tools like Graphite, CodeRabbit, or Cursor Bug Bot, Tembo will validate and commit relevant changes if you enable this feature.

## Setting up integrations

Getting started with Tembo is straightforward - connect the tools your team already uses:

- **Source control** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for creating PRs
- **Issue tracking** (Linear, Jira, Github Issues) for ticket assignments
- **Productivity Tools** (Slack, Raycast) for ticketless work assignment
- **Monitoring** (Sentry) for automatic error detection
- **Databases** (PostgreSQL, Supabase, AWS RDS) for performance optimization

Most integrations use OAuth for secure connection. After authorization, Tembo syncs your data and you can activate the repositories or projects you want monitored. Once active, Tembo immediately starts scanning and can begin working on assigned issues or detected issues.
