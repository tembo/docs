<Update label="2025-11-23" tags={["Cursor CLI", "Integrations", "Automations", "Slack", "Pull Requests"]}>

## Enhanced Cursor CLI Support

Tembo now supports the latest AI models in the Cursor CLI, giving you access to cutting-edge capabilities:

- **GPT-5.1** - The latest OpenAI model with improved reasoning and code generation
- **GPT-5.1 Codex** - Specialized variant optimized for complex coding tasks
- **Gemini 3** - Google's newest model with enhanced context understanding

## Ask Tembo Anywhere

You can now ask Tembo questions directly in GitHub pull requests and Slack messages. Simply mention `@tembo` with your question and get instant answers about your code, architecture, or project context - without leaving your workflow.

## Stateful Scheduled Automations

Scheduled automations are now more powerful with persistent state management. Automations can now:

- Store information between runs
- Track progress across multiple executions
- Build on previous results
- Maintain context over time

This enables more sophisticated workflows like incremental updates, progressive migrations, and long-running optimization tasks.

## Notion Integration

Connect Tembo with Notion to sync task management, documentation, and knowledge bases. Create tasks directly from Notion pages and keep your documentation in sync with your codebase.

Learn more in our [Notion integration documentation](/integrations/notion).

## Signed Commits

All commits created by Tembo through the GitHub integration are now automatically signed and verified, ensuring that automated changes are authenticated and trusted. You'll see the "Verified" badge on all Tembo commits in GitHub.

Learn more about [signed commits](/features/pull-requests#signed-commits) in our documentation.

## Improvements

Various bug fixes and performance improvements across the platform.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-11-04" tags={["API", "Automations", "Billing", "MCP", "Multi-Agent Support", "Nix", "Raycast", "Sandbox"]}>

We just shipped our biggest release yet - making background coding agents more autonomous, flexible, and secure than ever.

## Automations

Tembo now fixes issues before you even notice them. Trigger from GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Slack or on a schedule. It'll generate changelogs, clear TODOs, patch vulnerabilities, and clean up tech debt automatically.

## Multi-Agent + Model Support

Every team works differently. Now you can choose your preferred agent + model per task or across your org. Claude Code, Codex, Opencode, Amp, Cursor – powered by Anthropic, OpenAI, and more.

![Multi-Agent + Model Support](/images/multi-agent-support.png)

## Iterate with @tembo

Leave feedback anywhere – GitHub, Slack, or Linear. Tembo reads it, updates the code, and opens a fresh PR.

![Iterate with @tembo](/images/iterate-with-tembo.png)

## Sandbox + Nix

Each task runs safely in its own docker VM with Node, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, and Elixir ready to go. Using Nix? Tembo automatically loads your exact dev shell.

## MCP + Raycast + Billing + API

Extend agents with the model context protocol, manage tasks straight from raycast, use pay-as-you-go credits, and plug Tembo into anything with the new public API.

<Update label="2025-09-26" tags={["Coding Agents", "Design", "Settings"]}>

## More Coding Agents

Tembo now supports multiple AI coding agents, giving you the flexibility to work with your preferred development environment while leveraging Tembo's autonomous task management capabilities.

### New Coding Agent Integrations

- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** - Full integration with OpenCode using Anthropic models. Support for additional OpenCode providers coming soon.
- **Codex** - Now supported via API (UI support in progress)
- **Claude Code** - Enhanced support for the latest Claude models
- **Additional Coding Agents** - Cursor, Gemini, and Amp coming soon

![Coding Agent Support](/images/agent-support.png)

You can view all supported coding agents and their configurations here: [Coding Agents](/features/coding-agents).

### Claude 4.5 Sonnet

Added support for the new Claude 4.5 Sonnet model, bringing enhanced code understanding and generation capabilities to all supported coding agents.

## Public API & SDK

Tembo now provides a public API for programmatic task management and automation. You can create tasks, monitor their status, and integrate Tembo into your existing workflows.

- **[Public API Documentation](https://docs.tembo.io/api-reference/public-api/create-task)** - Create and manage tasks programmatically
- **[Tembo SDK](https://github.com/tembo/sdk)** - Official SDK for simplified API integration

## Redesigned Dashboard & Settings

We've completely reimagined the Tembo dashboard with a focus on clarity and efficiency:

- **Modern Interface** - Clean, intuitive design that makes task management effortless
- **Enhanced Settings Pages** - Streamlined configuration with better organization and improved discoverability
- **Improved Navigation** - Faster access to the features you use most
- **Better Visual Hierarchy** - Clearer presentation of task status, coding agent activity, and system state

## Performance & Stability

### GitHub Feedback Loop

The feedback cycle for GitHub pull requests and comments is now significantly faster. Tembo responds more quickly to code reviews, comments, and status changes, reducing wait times and accelerating your development workflow.

### Comment Tagging System

Introduced required tagging when leaving comments on pull requests. This prevents Tembo from responding to:

- Internal team discussions
- Comments directed at other team members
- Messages intended for other bot integrations

Simply tag `@tembo` when you want Tembo to take action, ensuring cleaner communication and more precise automation.
