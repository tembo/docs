<Update label="2025-08-02" tags={["Task Management", "Logging", "Claude Code", "Bug Fixes"]}>

## Close Task Button
You can now close tasks directly from the task interface with a dedicated close button. 

This streamlines task management by giving you instant control over task lifecycles without navigating through multiple screens.

## Enhanced Logging for Pull Requests
We've improved our logging system to track PR opened events, making it easier to monitor pull request activity across your repositories.

Better visibility into your development workflow helps teams stay on top of code review processes.

## Claude Code Log Parsing Improvements  
Enhanced error handling when parsing Claude Code logs — the system now properly logs stdout when parsing fails.

This improvement helps with debugging and provides better visibility into what's happening under the hood.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
Various bug fixes and improvements across the platform.

<Update label="2025-07-04" tags={["Jira", "UI", "Logs", "Bug Fixes"]}>

## Jira Integration  
You can now assign Tembo to Jira issues — just like with Linear. 

This was one of our most requested features by larger teams, and it’s finally live!

## Revamped UI  
The dashboard got a full redesign — it's now much faster and way cleaner.

We're also actively redesigning all app flows. You'll start seeing those changes roll out soon :)

## Historical Task Logs  
You can now view logs directly on the task page.

The new format makes it way easier to understand what actually happened.

## Credit Burn Bug + Fixes  
We fixed a bug where the GitHub scanner was burning credits in the background.

Also shipped a bunch of smaller polish and fixes across the app.

<Update label="2025-06-27" tags={["Sentry", "Tasks", "Rule Files"]}>

## Auto-fix for Sentry errors
Tembo now opens a pull request as soon as a Sentry error is detected — no delay between error and fix.

## Custom tasks
You can now create tasks directly in Tembo without relying on external tools like Jira or Linear. Just describe the task in plain English and Tembo will take it from there.

## Rule file support
Tembo now reads rule files to better understand your project’s structure and conventions. Supported files include:

- `tembo.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.clinerules`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

<Update label="2025-06-20" tags={["Task Prioritization", "CI/CD", "Automation"]}>

## Task Prioritization

Write a quick prompt about what you're trying to achieve and Tembo will rank your open tasks by impact. It learns from titles, labels, commit history and surfaces what's worth tackling first.

## Failed Workflows Auto-Fix

Tembo now reacts to failed workflows. Broken tests, failed lints – it finds the issue and pushes a fix. No more chasing red pipelines.

## Improvements

A bunch of bug fixes and polish across the board.

<Update label="2025-06-13" tags={["Pull Requests", "Feedback", "Models"]}>

## Feedback Loop in PRs

This one's huge. Leave a review or single comments — Tembo will now respond to all of them in one go. Way less back and forth, way faster iteration.

## Model Selection

You can now choose which model Tembo uses — currently supports Claude 3.5 and 3.7. Want Sonnet 4? Just bring your own API key in settings. More models coming soon.

## Coming Next Week

Task prioritization: Tembo will start finding the highest-impact tasks on its own. Set your goals — Tembo gets to work.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-06" tags={["Linear", "Onboarding", "Stability"]}>

If your first try with Tembo wasn't smooth, now's the perfect time to come back. We've made big stability improvements. Everything feels a lot snappier.

## Linear Support is Live 🎉

You can now assign Tembo to issues by adding a label or assigning the bot directly. Just install the Linear integration — and that's it.

## Onboarding Got a Glow-Up
