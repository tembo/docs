<Update label="2025-09-26" tags={["Agents", "Design", "Settings"]}>

## Multi-Agent Support

Tembo now supports multiple AI coding agents, giving you the flexibility to work with your preferred development environment while leveraging Tembo's autonomous task management capabilities.

### New Agent Integrations

- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** - Full integration with OpenCode using Anthropic models. Support for additional OpenCode providers coming soon.
- **Codex** - Now supported via API (UI support in progress)
- **Claude Code** - Enhanced support for the latest Claude models
- **Additional Agents** - Cursor, Gemini, and Amp coming soon

![Agent Support](/images/agent-support.png)

You can view all supported agents and their configurations here: [Agents](/features/agents).

### Claude 4.5 Sonnet

Added support for the new Claude 4.5 Sonnet model, bringing enhanced code understanding and generation capabilities to all supported agents.

## Public API & SDK

Tembo now provides a public API for programmatic task management and automation. You can create tasks, monitor their status, and integrate Tembo into your existing workflows.

- **[Public API Documentation](https://docs.tembo.io/api-reference/public-api/create-task)** - Create and manage tasks programmatically
- **[Tembo SDK](https://github.com/tembo/sdk)** - Official SDK for simplified API integration

## Redesigned Dashboard & Settings

We've completely reimagined the Tembo dashboard with a focus on clarity and efficiency:

- **Modern Interface** - Clean, intuitive design that makes task management effortless
- **Enhanced Settings Pages** - Streamlined configuration with better organization and improved discoverability
- **Improved Navigation** - Faster access to the features you use most
- **Better Visual Hierarchy** - Clearer presentation of task status, agent activity, and system state

## Performance & Stability

### GitHub Feedback Loop

The feedback cycle for GitHub pull requests and comments is now significantly faster. Tembo responds more quickly to code reviews, comments, and status changes, reducing wait times and accelerating your development workflow.

### Comment Tagging System

Introduced required tagging when leaving comments on pull requests. This prevents Tembo from responding to:
- Internal team discussions
- Comments directed at other team members
- Messages intended for other bot integrations

Simply tag `@tembo` when you want Tembo to take action, ensuring cleaner communication and more precise automation.

<Update label="2025-09-05" tags={["Image Support", "File Mentions", "Claude Code", "Pull Requests", "Settings", "Branch Management"]}>

## Image Support

Tembo's sandboxes now support images - works with all the major coding agents and allows them to read images but also push them to your repos. Images inside of Linear are also detected and downloaded to the sandboxes automatically. Learn more about our [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment).

## File Mentions & Smart References

Introduced @mention functionality for referencing files, integrations, and documents directly in task descriptions and comments.

![File Mentions Autocomplete](/images/file-mentions-autocomplete.png)

Features include:

- @mention support for integrations (GitHub, Linear, Sentry)
- File and document reference system
- Smart autocomplete
- Visual indicators for different mention types
- Context awareness in conversations

## Branch Deletion Setting

Added a new setting to control automatic branch deletion when pull requests are closed or merged.

![Branch Deletion Setting](/images/branch-deletion-setting.png)

When enabled, Tembo will automatically delete the branch after its pull request is closed or merged. This helps keep your repository clean by removing feature branches that are no longer needed.

The setting can be found in your pull request configuration and is disabled by default, giving you full control over branch cleanup behavior.

## Pull Request Settings

Support for [Gemini code assist](https://codeassist.google/) as a review bot.

<Update label="2025-07-04" tags={["Jira", "UI", "Logs", "Bug Fixes"]}>

## Jira Integration

You can now assign Tembo to Jira issues â€” just like with Linear.

This was one of our most requested features by larger teams, and itâ€™s finally live!

![Jira Integration](/images/introducing-jira.png)

## Revamped UI

The dashboard got a full redesign â€” it's now much faster and way cleaner.

We're also actively redesigning all app flows. You'll start seeing those changes roll out soon :)

![New UI](/images/product-screenshot.png)

## Historical Task Logs

You can now view logs directly on the task page.

The new format makes it way easier to understand what actually happened.

![Task Logs](/images/historical-task-logs.png)

## Credit Burn Bug + Fixes

We fixed a bug where the GitHub scanner was burning credits in the background.

Also shipped a bunch of smaller polish and fixes across the app.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-27" tags={["Sentry", "Tasks", "Rule Files"]}>

## Auto-fix for Sentry errors

Tembo now opens a pull request as soon as a Sentry error is detected â€” no delay between error and fix.

![Improved Sentry integration](/images/temo-sentry.png)

## Custom tasks

You can now create tasks directly in Tembo without relying on external tools like Jira or Linear. Just describe the task in plain English and Tembo will take it from there.

![Custom tasks](/images/custom-tasks.png)

## Rule file support

Tembo now reads rule files to better understand your projectâ€™s structure and conventions. Supported files include:

- `tembo.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.clinerules`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

<Update label="2025-06-20" tags={["Task Prioritization", "CI/CD", "Automation"]}>

## Task Prioritization

Write a quick prompt about what you're trying to achieve and Tembo will rank your open tasks by impact. It learns from titles, labels, commit history and surfaces what's worth tackling first.

![Suggested Tasks](/images/suggested-tasks.png)

## Failed Workflows Auto-Fix

![Suggested Tasks](/images/failed-actions.png)

Tembo now reacts to failed workflows. Broken tests, failed lints â€“ it finds the issue and pushes a fix. No more chasing red pipelines.

## Improvements

A bunch of bug fixes and polish across the board.

## What's Next?

What integration should we build next? Email us at [support@tembo.ai](mailto:support@tembo.ai) and we'll get back to you.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-13" tags={["Pull Requests", "Feedback", "Models"]}>

## Feedback Loop in PRs

This one's huge. Leave a review or single comments â€” Tembo will now respond to all of them in one go. Way less back and forth, way faster iteration.

![Feedback Loop](/images/feedback-loop.png)

## Model Selection

You can now choose which model Tembo uses â€” currently supports Claude 3.5 and 3.7. Want Sonnet 4? Just bring your own API key in settings. More models coming soon.

![Select Model](/images/select-model.png)

## Coming Next Week

Task prioritization: Tembo will start finding the highest-impact tasks on its own. Set your goals â€” Tembo gets to work.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-06" tags={["Linear", "Onboarding", "Stability"]}>

If your first try with Tembo wasn't smooth, now's the perfect time to come back. We've made big stability improvements. Everything feels a lot snappier.

## Linear Support is Live ðŸŽ‰

[![Linear Support](/images/linear-video.png)](https://x.com/benjaminakar/status/1928562385347870865)

You can now assign Tembo to issues by adding a label or assigning the bot directly. Just install the Linear integration â€” and that's it.

## Onboarding Got a Glow-Up

![Onboarding](/images/onboarding.png)

Just connect GitHub â€” Tembo guides you through the rest. And if you come back later, we'll bring you right back in.
