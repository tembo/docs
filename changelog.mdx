</Update>

<Update label="2025-11-04" tags={["API", "Automations", "Billing", "MCP", "Multi-Agent Support", "Nix", "Raycast", "Sandbox"]}>

We just shipped our biggest release yet - making background coding agents more autonomous, flexible, and secure than ever.

## Automations

Tembo now fixes issues before you even notice them. Trigger from GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Slack or on a schedule. It'll generate changelogs, clear TODOs, patch vulnerabilities, and clean up tech debt automatically.

![Automations](/images/automations.png)

## Multi-Agent + Model Support

Every team works differently. Now you can choose your preferred agent + model per task or across your org. Claude Code, Codex, Opencode, Amp, Cursor – powered by Anthropic, OpenAI, and more.

![Multi-Agent + Model Support](/images/multi-agent-support.png)

## Iterate with @tembo

Leave feedback anywhere – GitHub, Slack, or Linear. Tembo reads it, updates the code, and opens a fresh PR.

![Iterate with @tembo](/images/iterate-with-tembo.png)

## Sandbox + Nix

Each task runs safely in its own docker VM with Node, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, and Elixir ready to go. Using Nix? Tembo automatically loads your exact dev shell.

## MCP + Raycast + Billing + API

Extend agents with the model context protocol, manage tasks straight from raycast, use pay-as-you-go credits, and plug Tembo into anything with the new public API.

<Update label="2025-09-26" tags={["Coding Agents", "Design", "Settings"]}>

## More Coding Agents

Tembo now supports multiple AI coding agents, giving you the flexibility to work with your preferred development environment while leveraging Tembo's autonomous task management capabilities.

### New Coding Agent Integrations

- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** - Full integration with OpenCode using Anthropic models. Support for additional OpenCode providers coming soon.
- **Codex** - Now supported via API (UI support in progress)
- **Claude Code** - Enhanced support for the latest Claude models
- **Additional Coding Agents** - Cursor, Gemini, and Amp coming soon

![Coding Agent Support](/images/agent-support.png)

You can view all supported coding agents and their configurations here: [Coding Agents](/features/coding-agents).

### Claude 4.5 Sonnet

Added support for the new Claude 4.5 Sonnet model, bringing enhanced code understanding and generation capabilities to all supported coding agents.

## Public API & SDK

Tembo now provides a public API for programmatic task management and automation. You can create tasks, monitor their status, and integrate Tembo into your existing workflows.

- **[Public API Documentation](https://docs.tembo.io/api-reference/public-api/create-task)** - Create and manage tasks programmatically
- **[Tembo SDK](https://github.com/tembo/sdk)** - Official SDK for simplified API integration

## Redesigned Dashboard & Settings

We've completely reimagined the Tembo dashboard with a focus on clarity and efficiency:

- **Modern Interface** - Clean, intuitive design that makes task management effortless
- **Enhanced Settings Pages** - Streamlined configuration with better organization and improved discoverability
- **Improved Navigation** - Faster access to the features you use most
- **Better Visual Hierarchy** - Clearer presentation of task status, coding agent activity, and system state

## Performance & Stability

### GitHub Feedback Loop

The feedback cycle for GitHub pull requests and comments is now significantly faster. Tembo responds more quickly to code reviews, comments, and status changes, reducing wait times and accelerating your development workflow.

### Comment Tagging System

Introduced required tagging when leaving comments on pull requests. This prevents Tembo from responding to:

- Internal team discussions
- Comments directed at other team members
- Messages intended for other bot integrations

Simply tag `@tembo` when you want Tembo to take action, ensuring cleaner communication and more precise automation.

<Update label="2025-09-05" tags={["Branch Management", "Claude Code", "File Mentions", "Image Support", "Pull Requests", "Settings"]}>

## Image Support

Tembo's sandboxes now support images - works with all the major coding agents and allows them to read images but also push them to your repos. Images inside of Linear are also detected and downloaded to the sandboxes automatically. Learn more about our [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment).

## File Mentions & Smart References

Introduced @mention functionality for referencing files, integrations, and documents directly in task descriptions and comments.

![File Mentions Autocomplete](/images/file-mentions-autocomplete.png)
