<Update label="2026-02-13">

## Sidebar: Recent Tasks

The sidebar now features a **Recent Tasks** section that shows you a list of your
most recent in-progress and completed tasks. This gives you quick access to jump
back into active work or review what was recently finished — without needing to
navigate to the full tasks page.

## Insights page

![Insights page showing Tembo’s contribution and pull request trends](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf9e29b1-8892-4526-a6c2-38f135474a64)

You can now use the new **Insights** page (in the sidebar) to understand how
Tembo is impacting your engineering throughput, including:

- Your Tembo contribution (% of merged PRs created with Tembo)
- PR creation and merge trends over time
- Breakdowns by repository and by teammate

## New models

Two additional models are now available:

- GLM 5
- Kimi K2.5

## Diff view in tasks

Tasks now include a new diff view, including a dedicated **View diff** action
from the task header. You can also merge or close pull requests right from
within Tembo (without switching to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

![Diff view in a Tembo task, with actions to view the diff and merge or close the pull request](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7849b33-25cc-40ab-a326-9eb2471afab0)

## GitHub automation trigger: Tembo Pull Request Opened

You can now trigger automations when a pull request created by Tembo is opened
(great for automatically kicking off follow-up workflows like PR review,
notifications, or audits).

## Refreshed sign in and sign up

The sign in and sign up experience has been refreshed, making it easier for you
to get started and get back to work quickly.

![Refreshed Tembo sign in and sign up page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0247f5f-cc13-4fa8-9ca6-a57637fb6a21)

on a Tembo PR to request changes, and Tembo will iterate and post the result
back to the PR.

Learn more: [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## More Jira automation options

![Jira automation trigger filters in Tembo](/images/jira-automation-options.png)

Jira automations got more powerful (and more precise):

- New trigger: **Issue Assigned to User**
- More filtering for **Issue Created**, including filtering by **labels**
- Smarter repository detection using Jira issue labels

## GitLab trigger parity

GitLab automations now have trigger parity with GitHub, including merge request,
issue, and CI events (like merge request opened/updated/merged, issue comments,
pipeline failures, and new refs).

## API keys improvements

- Removed the API key limit of 10 per organization
- Improved the API keys page empty state

## Onboarding polish

- Added an “Assign a Linear ticket” get-started card
- Reduced onboarding and dashboard loading-state flicker

Sandbox logs are now easier to scan:

- Clear event type labels and timestamps
- Collapsible JSON payloads for deeper details
- Improved scrolling behavior (including a scroll-to-bottom button)

## Atlassian MCP (Jira + Confluence)

If you’ve connected Atlassian, you can now enable an Atlassian MCP server for
your tasks. This gives the agent direct access to Jira and Confluence actions
from within the task environment.

## New Jira automation trigger: ticket added to board

You can now trigger Jira automations when a new ticket is added to a board, so
your workflows can kick off earlier in triage.

## Richer agent logs

Agent logs got a few quality-of-life upgrades:

- A “Planning next moves” indicator while the agent is thinking
- File icons in diff views
- Better icon mapping for Atlassian-related tool events

## Redesigned PR description buttons

When Tembo opens a pull request, you’ll now see beautifully redesigned buttons in
the PR description (like **View on Tembo** and **View Agent Settings**) to jump
to the right place faster.

![Redesigned PR description buttons in a GitHub pull request description](/images/pr-description-buttons.png)

## Linear automation trigger: filter by label on “Issue Created”

When using the Linear “issue created” trigger, you can now optionally filter by
label so automations only run for the issues you care about.

## Redesigned Events tab (audit log)

The **Events** tab in the app sidebar has been redesigned to make it easier to
review the audit log of actions taken across your workspace.

![Events tab in the Tembo sidebar showing the workspace audit log](/images/events-tab-audit-log.png)

## Java toolchain in sandboxes

Sandboxes now include Java (JDK 21) plus Gradle and Maven, so agents can build
and run Java projects without extra setup.

## Improvements

Various bug fixes and improvements as always :)

</Update>

<Update label="2026-01-16">

## New agent logs

New agent logs have been shipped for all agents including Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. Works with all models. Agent logs got a full visual refresh with clearer event grouping, richer tool input rendering (diffs, commands, file writes), and easier-to-scan status/error states.

![Agent Logs Redesign](/images/agent-logs-redesign.png)

## GPT-5.2 Codex model support

Added `gpt-5.2-codex` as an available model option for Codex CLI and Opencode agents.

## Reasoning level controls
