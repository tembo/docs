**Effective Date:** January 27, 2025

Keeping your database environments and source code secure is critically important to us. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it to [security@tembo.io](mailto:security@tembo.io).

## Certifications

Tembo is **SOC 2 Type II compliant**. We commit to annual third-party penetration testing to ensure the highest security standards. We also operate under **GDPR-aligned data handling practices**, and **HIPAA compliance is currently in progress**.

For more information about our compliance status, visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.delve.co/tembo).

## Infrastructure Security

Tembo's infrastructure is built on trusted subprocessors, each serving a specific role in our system:

| Subprocessor | Purpose | Details |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **AWS** | Front-end and API infrastructure | US-based hosting |
| **Tembo Cloud** | System metadata storage | Secure metadata management |
| **Anthropic** | AI models | Zero data retention agreement |
| **LangFuse** | AI process tracing | Observability and monitoring |
| **Sentry** | Exception tracking | Error monitoring and debugging |
| **Stripe** | Billing | Payment processing |
| **Clerk** | Authentication | User authentication and management |

### Security Practices

- **No infrastructure in China** - All infrastructure is located in trusted regions
- **Least-privilege access** - Access is granted on a need-to-know basis
- **Multi-factor authentication** - Required for all AWS access
- **Network-level controls** - Protected by network segmentation and firewalls
- **Secrets-based access** - Secure credential management and rotation

## AI Requests and Data

### Code and Repository Data

Tembo **does not store your code long-term**. When Tembo runs a task, it spins up an isolated [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment), pulls only the repository context needed for the task, performs the work, opens a PR, and the environment is discarded afterwards. Full copies of customer repositories are not retained in persistent storage.

- All data is **encrypted in transit and at rest**
- Access is **tightly controlled and logged**

### Chat and Interaction Data

Chat messages and text used in interactions with Tembo are stored more persistently to enable conversation history and task continuity. We recommend **avoiding including any PII or sensitive data** (such as patient information, credentials, or personal identifiers) in issues, chat messages, logs, and repositories regardless of tooling — this is best practice across the stack.

**Important:** You own all the code generated by Tembo.

## Account Deletion

You can delete your account at any time through the Settings dashboard. When you delete your account:

- Complete data removal occurs within 30 days
- Deleted data will not be used in future model training
- All associated repositories and integrations are disconnected

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We take security reports seriously and follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. **Acknowledgment** - We acknowledge reports within 5 business days
2. **Investigation** - Our security team investigates the reported vulnerability
3. **Resolution** - We work to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities promptly
4. **Disclosure** - Results are published on our [GitHub security page](https://github.com/tembo/security)

### Critical Incidents

In the event of a critical security incident, we will:

- Communicate via GitHub security advisories
- Send email notifications to affected users
- Provide detailed information about the incident and remediation steps
