Keeping your database environments and source code secure is critically important to us. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it to [security@tembo.io](mailto:security@tembo.io).

## Certifications

Tembo is **SOC 2 Type 1 certified** and commits to annual third-party penetration testing to ensure the highest security standards.

## Infrastructure Security

Tembo's infrastructure is built on trusted subprocessors, each serving a specific role in our system:

| Subprocessor | Purpose | Details |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **AWS** | Front-end and API infrastructure | US-based hosting |
| **Tembo Cloud** | System metadata storage | Secure metadata management |
| **Anthropic** | AI models | Zero data retention agreement |
| **LangFuse** | AI process tracing | Observability and monitoring |
| **Sentry** | Exception tracking | Error monitoring and debugging |
| **Stripe** | Billing | Payment processing |
| **Clerk** | Authentication | User authentication and management |

### Security Practices

- **No infrastructure in China** - All infrastructure is located in trusted regions
- **Least-privilege access** - Access is granted on a need-to-know basis
- **Multi-factor authentication** - Required for all AWS access
- **Network-level controls** - Protected by network segmentation and firewalls
- **Secrets-based access** - Secure credential management and rotation

When you use Tembo, AI requests include context such as viewed files and conversation history. Code data is sent to our AWS infrastructure for processing.

**Important:** You own all the code generated by Tembo.
