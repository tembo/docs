Tembo offers flexible subscription plans and a credit-based system to meet your needs.

## Subscription Plans

Choose the plan that best fits your usage:

- **Free ($0/month)** - 5 credits per day included
- **Pro ($60/month)** - 100 credits per month with overage billing
- **Max ($200/month)** - 400 credits per month with overage billing

All paid plans include overage billing, so you can continue using Tembo even after consuming your monthly credit allocation. You can set a maximum overage limit to control spending. On the Free plan, service is paused when you run out of credits until your daily allocation refreshes or you upgrade to a paid plan or purchase additional credits.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed when Tembo analyzes your code and generates pull requests:

- **Complex issues may require more credits** - Credit consumption is based on LLM tokens used, which varies depending on the complexity of the task
- **Simple fixes use fewer credits** - Straightforward tasks typically consume fewer tokens and therefore fewer credits
- **Credits never expire** - Purchase credits at your own pace without worrying about expiration
- **Unused credits roll over** - Any credits you don't use remain in your account indefinitely

## What Consumes Credits

Credits are used for:

- Creating pull requests from assigned issues (Linear, Jira, Slack)
- Fixing production errors detected from Sentry
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Processing feedback on pull requests through the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## Credit Refunds

In certain situations, you may receive automatic credit refunds:

- **Failed tasks** - If Tembo is unable to complete a task due to an internal error, the credit is refunded
- **Duplicate issues** - If the same issue is queued multiple times, duplicate attempts may be refunded
- **Invalid inputs** - Tasks that fail due to configuration issues or missing access may be refunded

## Usage and Monitoring

You can monitor your credit consumption in real-time through the [Billing dashboard](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) in your Tembo app.

## Purchasing Credits

All subscription plans include a credit allocation. If you need additional credits beyond your allocation:

- **Free plan users** - Upgrade to Pro or Max for automatic overage billing, or purchase credit packs as needed
- **Pro and Max users** - Overage billing is automatic when you exceed your monthly allocation. You can set a maximum overage limit to control spending.
- **Additional credit packs** - All users can purchase additional credits through the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) at any time

To get started or change your subscription plan, visit the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) within the Tembo app.

## Auto-Reload

Auto-reload automatically purchases credits when your balance falls below a threshold, ensuring uninterrupted service.

### Setting Up Auto-Reload

1. Navigate to [Billing settings](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing)
2. Add a payment method if needed
3. Configure: reload threshold (default: 100), target balance (default: 1000), and monthly limit (default: 1000 credits)
4. Toggle auto-reload on

### Important Notes

- **Payment method required** - Cannot delete your payment method while auto-reload is enabled
- **Monthly limits prevent runaway charges** - The system won't exceed your monthly limit even if balance is below threshold
- **Manual purchases still available** - You can purchase credits anytime, even with auto-reload enabled

## Troubleshooting

**Auto-reload not working?** Check: active payment method, balance below threshold, monthly limit not reached, toggle enabled in [Billing settings](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing).

**Can't delete payment method?** Disable auto-reload first, then delete.

**Payment failed?** Verify card is valid with sufficient funds.

**Didn't receive full target balance?** Auto-reload won't exceed your monthly limit.

**Credits not appearing?** Processing takes a few minutes. After 10 minutes, verify all requirements are met.
