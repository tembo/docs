## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed when Tembo analyzes your code and generates pull requests:

- **Complex issues may require more credits** - Credit consumption is based on LLM tokens used, which varies depending on the complexity of the task
- **Simple fixes use fewer credits** - Straightforward tasks typically consume fewer tokens and therefore fewer credits
- **Credits never expire** - Purchase credits at your own pace without worrying about expiration
- **Unused credits roll over** - Any credits you don't use remain in your account indefinitely

## What Consumes Credits

Credits are used for:

- Creating pull requests from assigned issues (Linear, Jira, Slack)
- Fixing production errors detected from Sentry
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Processing feedback on pull requests through the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## Credit Refunds

In certain situations, you may receive automatic credit refunds:

- **Failed tasks** - If Tembo is unable to complete a task due to an internal error, the credit is refunded
- **Duplicate issues** - If the same issue is queued multiple times, duplicate attempts may be refunded
- **Invalid inputs** - Tasks that fail due to configuration issues or missing access may be refunded

## Usage and Monitoring

You can monitor your credit consumption in real-time through the [Billing dashboard](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) in your Tembo app.

## Managing Your Subscription

You can manage your subscription and purchase additional credits through the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) within the Tembo app.

### Purchasing Additional Credits

In addition to your daily credit allocation, you can purchase additional credits at any time:

- Credits purchased separately never expire
- Additional credits can be used alongside your daily allocation
- Available for all plan tiers, including the Free plan

## Auto-Reload

Auto-reload automatically purchases additional credits when your balance falls below a threshold you set, ensuring uninterrupted service beyond your daily credit allocation.

### How Auto-Reload Works

Auto-reload monitors your credit balance and automatically purchases credits when needed:

- **Automatic monitoring** - Your credit balance is continuously monitored
- **Threshold-based reload** - When your balance drops below your configured threshold, credits are automatically purchased
- **Target balance** - Credits are added up to your specified target balance
- **Monthly limit** - A monthly spending limit prevents excessive charges
- **Payment method required** - You must have a payment method on file for auto-reload to function

### Setting Up Auto-Reload

To enable auto-reload:

1. Navigate to the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) in your Tembo app
2. Add a payment method if you haven't already
3. Configure your auto-reload settings:
   - **Enable auto-reload** - Toggle auto-reload on or off
   - **Reload when balance below** - Set the credit threshold that triggers a reload (default: 100 credits)
   - **Target balance** - Set your desired balance after reload (default: 1000 credits)
   - **Monthly credit limit** - Set the maximum amount you're willing to spend per month (default: 1000 credits)

### Important Notes

- **Payment method required** - Auto-reload requires at least one payment method on file. You cannot delete your payment method while auto-reload is enabled
- **Monthly limits** - Your monthly credit limit helps prevent unexpected charges. The system will not exceed this limit even if your balance is below the threshold
- **Manual purchases** - You can still manually purchase credits at any time, even with auto-reload enabled
- **Disabling auto-reload** - You can disable auto-reload at any time through the Billing settings page

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Reload Not Working

If auto-reload isn't triggering when expected:

1. **Verify payment method** - Ensure you have an active payment method on file. Auto-reload requires at least one valid payment method.
2. **Check threshold settings** - Confirm your balance has dropped below the configured threshold. Auto-reload only triggers when balance < threshold.
3. **Review monthly limit** - If you've reached your monthly credit limit, auto-reload won't purchase additional credits until the next billing cycle.
4. **Confirm auto-reload is enabled** - Double-check that the auto-reload toggle is in the "on" position in your [Billing settings](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing).

### Payment Method Issues

If you're having trouble with payment methods:

- **Cannot delete payment method** - You must disable auto-reload before removing your payment method. Toggle auto-reload off first, then delete the payment method.
- **Payment failed** - Check that your card is valid and has sufficient funds. Update your payment details in the Billing dashboard if needed.

### Credit Balance Questions

**Why didn't I receive the full target balance?**
Auto-reload will only add credits up to your monthly limit. If adding the full amount would exceed your monthly limit, only the remaining allowed amount will be purchased.

**My balance went below threshold but I don't see new credits.**
Auto-reload typically processes within a few minutes. If you don't see credits after 10 minutes, check that all auto-reload requirements are met (payment method on file, monthly limit not exceeded, auto-reload enabled).
