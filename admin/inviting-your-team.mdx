Collaborate with your team in Tembo by inviting members to your organization. Team members can work together on issues, review AI-generated pull requests, and manage integrations.

## Roles and Permissions

### Members

Team members have access to:

- **Assign issues to Tembo** from Linear, Jira, Slack, or directly through the dashboard
- **Review pull requests** created by Tembo across all connected repositories
- **Provide feedback** through the feedback loop to iterate on Tembo's work
- **View organization activity** including completed tasks and active issues
- **Configure repository settings** including rule files and coding agent preferences

### Admins

Administrators have all member permissions plus:

- **Manage billing** and subscription settings
- **Configure integrations** for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Sentry, and other services
- **Invite and remove team members** from the organization
- **Control repository access** and activation settings
- **View usage metrics** and team performance analytics

## Inviting Team Members

To invite team members to your Tembo organization:

1. Navigate to your [Tembo Dashboard](https://app.tembo.io)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
3. Click **Invite Member**
4. Enter the email address of the team member
5. Select their role (Member or Admin)
6. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited member will receive an email with instructions to join your organization.

## Best Practices

- **Start with core contributors** — Invite developers who frequently review PRs first for the most valuable feedback
- **Use Member role by default** — Reserve Admin for team leads who manage billing and integrations
- **Onboard gradually** — Start with a small group to establish workflows before expanding access
- **Set expectations** — Team members are responsible for reviewing and approving Tembo's PRs before merging

## Team Collaboration

Once your team is onboarded, you can:

- **Distribute issue assignments** across team members based on their expertise
- **Review PRs together** using your existing code review process
- **Share feedback patterns** to help Tembo learn your team's preferences
- **Monitor team activity** to understand how Tembo impacts your development velocity
