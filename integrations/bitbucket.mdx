Connect your Bitbucket repositories so that Tembo can open pull requests directly in your workspace.

# Features

- Automatically sync repositories from your Bitbucket workspaces
- Create and manage pull requests with AI-generated code changes
- Support for both draft and regular pull requests
- Repository selection for targeted automation

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Service User">
    Create a dedicated Bitbucket account for Tembo using either an email alias
    (`youremail+tembo@company.com`) or a dedicated email (`tembo@company.com`).
    Invite this account to your Bitbucket workspace and complete the sign-up process
    using the name "Tembo". This ensures that PRs are opened as "Tembo" rather than
    your personal account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Integration">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in
    Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Bitbucket. Make sure you're logged
    into the Tembo Bitbucket account (not your personal account) when completing this
    step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="OAuth Authorization">
    Complete the OAuth flow to grant Tembo access to your Bitbucket account.
    This will allow Tembo to:
    - Read your repositories and workspaces
    - Create branches and pull requests
    - Access repository metadata
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repositories">
    After connecting, Tembo will sync all accessible repositories from your
    Bitbucket workspaces. Choose the repositories you want Tembo to work with,
    including both your monorepo and docs repositories for full coverage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Configuration

## Repository Settings

Once connected, you can configure which repositories Tembo should monitor:

1. **Workspace Selection**: Tembo automatically discovers all workspaces your service user has access to
2. **Repository Selection**: Choose specific repositories from each workspace
3. **Default Branch**: Tembo will use the repository's default branch as the base for PRs

## Pull Request Settings

Configure how Tembo creates pull requests:

- **Draft PRs**: Enable to create pull requests as drafts by default
- **Branch Cleanup**: Pull requests automatically delete source branches when merged
- **PR Templates**: Use your repository's existing PR template if configured

# Usage

## Automatic Repository Sync

Tembo periodically syncs with your Bitbucket account to discover new repositories and update existing ones. The sync process:

1. Fetches all workspaces accessible to the connected account
2. Lists repositories within each workspace
3. Creates or updates repository records in Tembo
4. Maintains metadata about workspace and repository relationships

## Pull Request Creation

When Tembo creates a pull request:

1. **Branch Creation**: Creates a new branch from the default branch
2. **Code Changes**: Applies AI-generated changes to the branch
3. **PR Creation**: Opens a pull request with generated title and description
4. **Draft Status**: Respects your draft PR settings
5. **Source Branch Cleanup**: Automatically deletes the source branch when merged

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors
- Ensure the service user has proper permissions in the Bitbucket workspace
- Check that OAuth tokens haven't expired (Tembo handles automatic refresh)
- Verify the service user is a member of all required workspaces

### Repository Access
- Confirm the service user has read/write access to target repositories
- Check that repositories aren't archived or have restricted permissions
- Ensure the workspace has the correct access levels configured

### Pull Request Creation
- Verify branch protection rules don't prevent Tembo from creating PRs
- Check that the default branch is correctly configured
- Ensure the repository allows pull requests from the connected account

If you encounter persistent authentication issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting the Bitbucket integration.

# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to common Bitbucket events and maps them to workflow triggers (reference them as `bitbucket.<category>` in your `triggerName`, e.g., `bitbucket.pull_request.opened`). Supported events:

- `pull_request.opened`
- `pull_request.updated`
- `pull_request.reopened`
- `pull_request.approved`
- `pull_request.unapproved`
- `pull_request.merged`
- `pull_request.closed`
- `pull_request.comment_created`

See Workflow Automations for creating triggers from these events.
