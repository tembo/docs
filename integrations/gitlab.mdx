# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to common GitLab events and maps them to workflow triggers (reference them as `gitlab.<category>` in your `triggerName`, e.g., `gitlab.merge_request.opened`). Supported categories include:

- Merge request events: opened, closed, reopened, draft/ready, edits
- Comments on merge requests (notes)
- Review/approval submissions

See Workflow Automations for creating triggers from these events.
