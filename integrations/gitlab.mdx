# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to GitLab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your GitLab account. You can select specific repositories or all repositories. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Repositories">
    After syncing completes (may take a few minutes), select which repositories you want Tembo to scan under "Active Repositories" on the Integrations page.

    Only repositories you activate here will be scanned for issues and receive improvement merge requests.

# Usage

## Automated Scanning

Once activated, Tembo automatically scans for TODO comments, security issues, performance problems, technical debt, and code quality issues.

## Merge Requests

When Tembo finds an addressable issue, it creates a merge request with the proposed fix, detailed description, and assigns it for team review.

# Working with Merge Requests

## Reviewing Merge Requests

Review Tembo's MRs just like any other team member's work:

- Examine the changes and verify they align with your requirements
- Leave comments directly on the code if you need changes
- Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) feature to have Tembo address your review comments automatically

## Commenting on MRs

When reviewing Tembo's merge requests, you can request changes or improvements by tagging `@tembo` in your comments. This ensures Tembo responds to your specific feedback while ignoring internal team discussions or comments directed at other team members.

**Example:**

```
@tembo Please update this function to include error handling
```

Without the `@tembo` tag, Tembo will not respond to the comment, allowing for cleaner team communication.

## Failed Pipeline Detection

Tembo automatically monitors your GitLab CI/CD pipelines and detects when they fail. When a pipeline fails due to broken tests, linting errors, or other issues, Tembo will analyze the failure, identify the root cause, and create an MR with a fix.

This helps maintain a healthy CI/CD pipeline without manual intervention.

## Best Practices

- Configure repository settings to match your team's preferences
- Use [Rule Files](/features/rule-files) to help Tembo understand your coding standards
- Set up [Hooks](/features/hooks) to customize Tembo's behavior for your workflow
