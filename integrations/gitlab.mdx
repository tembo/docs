# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to common GitLab events and maps them to workflow triggers (reference them as `gitlab.<category>` in your `triggerName`, e.g., `gitlab.merge_request.opened`). Supported events:

- `merge_request.opened`
- `merge_request.closed`
- `merge_request.reopened`
- `merge_request.ready_for_review`
- `merge_request.converted_to_draft`
- `merge_request.updated`
- `note.created` (comments on merge requests)
- `merge_request.approved`
- `merge_request.unapproved`

See Workflow Automations for creating triggers from these events.
