</Note>

Manage your Tembo tasks directly from Discord. Create tasks, track progress, and view repositories with slash commands in your servers or DMs.

# Features

- **Create Tasks** - Create new Tembo tasks with natural language prompts directly from Discord
- **View Tasks** - List and search through all your tasks with interactive pagination
- **Repository Management** - View connected repositories and their status
- **Per-User Authentication** - Each Discord user securely stores their own Tembo API key with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Works Anywhere** - Use in Discord servers or DMs with user-installable bot support
- **Autocomplete Support** - Smart autocomplete for agents and repositories when creating tasks

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bot to Discord">
    Add the Tembo Discord bot to your server or user account by visiting the [installation link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1438564757358645298). You can install it for personal use (works in DMs) or add it to a server you manage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Tembo API Key">
    Sign up for a Tembo account at [app.tembo.io](https://app.tembo.io) if you haven't already, then generate an API key from your Tembo dashboard under Settings → API Keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Your API Key">
    In Discord, run the `/setup` command with your API key:
    ```
    /setup key:YOUR_TEMBO_API_KEY
    ```
    The bot will validate your key, encrypt it, and store it securely. You'll see a confirmation message with your account information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Usage

## Creating Tasks

Use the `/task create` command to create new Tembo tasks from Discord. You can specify:

- Task prompt (required) - Natural language description of what you want to build or fix
- Agent model (optional) - Select from available Tembo agents with autocomplete
- Repositories (optional) - Choose which repository to work on with autocomplete
- Target branch (optional) - Specify the branch for the task

**Example:**
```
/task create prompt:"Fix authentication bug in login flow" agent:"claudeCode:claude-sonnet-4-5" repositories:"myorg/myrepo"
```

<img src="/images/discord-create-task.png" alt="Discord slash command interface for creating Tembo tasks" />

The bot will create the task and respond with the task details including ID, title, and repository information.

## Viewing and Searching Tasks

### List All Tasks

Use `/task list` to view your tasks with pagination:

```
/task list page:1 limit:10
```

Navigate through pages using the Previous/Next buttons attached to the message.

### Search Tasks

Use `/task search` to find specific tasks by keyword:

```
/task search query:"authentication" page:1
```

<img src="/images/discord-task-list.png" alt="Discord showing paginated task list with navigation buttons" />

Both commands support:
- **Interactive pagination** - Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
- **Adjustable page size** - Set limit from 1-25 tasks per page
- **Ephemeral responses** - Add `ephemeral:true` to make responses visible only to you

## Managing Repositories

View all your connected repositories:

```
/repositories list
```

This shows your GitHub, GitLab, or other connected code repositories with their URLs and IDs.

## Checking Your Status

Use `/whoami` to see your current Tembo account information:

```
/whoami ephemeral:true
```

This displays your name, email, organization, and account status.

Use `/status` to check if your API key is registered with the bot:

```
/status
```

# Best Practices

## Writing Effective Task Prompts

When creating tasks through Discord, provide clear and specific descriptions:

**Good Examples:**
- "Fix memory leak in background job processor at workers/job-processor.ts"
- "Add email validation to user registration form using RFC 5322 standard"
- "Refactor authentication middleware to use async/await patterns"
- "Update homepage design to match Figma mockups in src/components/Home.tsx"

**Less Effective:**
- "Fix the bug"
- "Improve performance"
- "Update the code"

The more specific your prompt, the better Tembo agents can understand and execute your task.

See the [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide) for more tips on writing effective task descriptions.

## Managing Your API Key

### Registering Your Key

When you first use the bot, you'll need to register your Tembo API key:

```
/setup key:YOUR_TEMBO_API_KEY
```

Your key is:
- Validated against the Tembo API before storage
- Encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
- Stored securely in a Cloudflare D1 database
- Never shared with other users

### Updating Your Key

To update your API key (for example, after rotation), simply run `/setup` again with your new key:

```
/setup key:YOUR_NEW_API_KEY
```

### Removing Your Key

If you want to unregister and remove your API key from the bot:

```
/unregister
```

You'll need to re-register with `/setup` to use the bot again.

## Privacy and Ephemeral Messages

Most commands support an `ephemeral` parameter. When set to `true`, the bot's response is only visible to you:

```
/task list ephemeral:true
/whoami ephemeral:true
```

This is useful for:
- Viewing sensitive task information in public channels
- Checking your account status privately
- Listing repositories without sharing with others

# Security

The Tembo Discord bot implements several security measures to protect your data:

**Per-User Authentication**
- Each Discord user maintains their own Tembo API key
- No cross-user access - your tasks and data remain private
- Keys are validated before storage

**Encrypted Storage**
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- Unique initialization vector (IV) and salt per encryption
- Master encryption key stored as a Cloudflare secret
- Additional authenticated data prevents tampering

**Request Verification**
- All Discord interactions are verified using Discord's signature verification
- Prevents unauthorized requests and impersonation
- Implements Discord's security best practices

**Minimal Permissions**
- Bot only requests necessary Discord permissions (Send Messages, Use Slash Commands)
- Serverless architecture on Cloudflare Workers with no persistent servers
- All communication over HTTPS

# Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to commands:**
- Verify the bot is added to your server or installed to your user account
- Check that you have registered your API key with `/setup`
- Ensure you're using the correct command syntax (use `/` to see available commands)

**"You need to register your Tembo API key" error:**
- Run `/setup key:YOUR_TEMBO_API_KEY` to register your key
- Verify your API key is valid by testing it at [app.tembo.io](https://app.tembo.io)
- Check `/status` to see your registration status

**"Application did not respond" error:**
- This usually means the Tembo API is taking longer than expected
- Try the command again - the bot uses background processing to avoid timeouts
- Contact support if the issue persists

**Tasks not appearing in list:**
- Verify you're logged in to the correct Tembo account with `/whoami`
- Check that tasks exist in your Tembo dashboard
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

**Cannot receive DM from bot:**
- Check your Discord privacy settings allow DMs from server members
- The bot sends onboarding instructions via DM when you first try to use it
- If DMs are blocked, the bot will show instructions in the channel instead
