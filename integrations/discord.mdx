Manage your Tembo tasks directly from Discord. Create tasks, track progress, and view repositories with slash commands in your servers or DMs.

# Features

- **Create Tasks** - Create new Tembo tasks with natural language prompts directly from Discord
- **View Tasks** - List and search through all your tasks with interactive pagination
- **Repository Management** - View connected repositories and their status
- **Per-User Authentication** - Each Discord user securely stores their own Tembo API key with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Works Anywhere** - Use in Discord servers or DMs with user-installable bot support
- **Autocomplete Support** - Smart autocomplete for agents and repositories when creating tasks

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bot to Discord">
    Add the Tembo Discord bot to your server or user account by visiting the [installation link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1438564757358645298). You can install it for personal use (works in DMs) or add it to a server you manage.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Tembo API Key">
    Sign up for a Tembo account at [app.tembo.io](https://app.tembo.io) if you haven't already, then generate an API key from your Tembo dashboard under Settings → API Keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Your API Key">
    In Discord, run the `/setup` command with your API key:
    ```text
    /setup key:YOUR_TEMBO_API_KEY
    ```
    The bot will validate your key, encrypt it, and store it securely. You'll see a confirmation message with your account information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Usage

## Creating Tasks

Use the `/task create` command to create new Tembo tasks from Discord. You can specify:

- Task prompt (required) - Natural language description of what you want to build or fix
- Agent model (optional) - Select from available Tembo agents with autocomplete
- Repositories (optional) - Choose which repository to work on with autocomplete
- Target branch (optional) - Specify the branch for the task

**Example:**
```text
/task create prompt:"Fix authentication bug in login flow" agent:"claudeCode:claude-sonnet-4-5" repositories:"myorg/myrepo"
```

<img src="/images/discord/discord_create_task.png" alt="Discord slash command interface for creating Tembo tasks" />

The bot will create the task and respond with the task details including ID, title, and repository information.

## Viewing and Searching Tasks

### List All Tasks

Use `/task list` to view your tasks with pagination:

```text
/task list page:1 limit:10
```

Navigate through pages using the Previous/Next buttons attached to the message.

### Search Tasks

Use `/task search` to find specific tasks by keyword:

```text
/task search query:"authentication" page:1
```

<img src="/images/discord/discord_task_list.png" alt="Discord task list with pagination controls" />

Both commands support:
- **Interactive pagination** - Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
- **Adjustable page size** - Set limit from 1-25 tasks per page
- **Ephemeral responses** - Add `ephemeral:true` to make responses visible only to you

## Managing Repositories

View all your connected repositories:

```text
/repositories list
```

<img src="/images/discord/discord_repo_list.png" alt="Discord repository list" />

This shows your GitHub, GitLab, or other connected code repositories with their URLs and IDs.

## Checking Your Status

Use `/whoami` to see your current Tembo account information:

```text
/whoami ephemeral:true
```

This displays your name, email, organization, and account status.

Use `/status` to check if your API key is registered with the bot:

```text
/status
```

# Best Practices

Write clear, specific task prompts with file paths, standards, or references (e.g., "Fix memory leak in workers/job-processor.ts" not "Fix the bug"). See the [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide) for detailed tips.

## Managing Your API Key

- **Update key** - Run `/setup key:YOUR_NEW_API_KEY` to replace your existing key
- **Remove key** - Run `/unregister` to delete your stored key (re-register with `/setup` to use the bot again)
- Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and validated before storage (see Security section below)

## Ephemeral Messages

Add `ephemeral:true` to any command (e.g., `/task list ephemeral:true`) to make responses visible only to you.

# Security

The Tembo Discord bot protects your data with:

- **Per-user authentication** — Each user stores their own validated API key; no cross-user access
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — Keys encrypted with unique IV/salt per user, master key in Cloudflare secrets
- **Request verification** — All Discord interactions verified using Discord's signature verification
- **Minimal permissions** — Only requests necessary Discord permissions; serverless on Cloudflare Workers over HTTPS

# Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond?** Verify the bot is installed, register your API key with `/setup`, and check command syntax (use `/` to see options).

**"Register your API key" error?** Run `/setup key:YOUR_KEY` and verify your key at [app.tembo.io](https://app.tembo.io). Use `/status` to check registration.

**"Application did not respond"?** The API may be slow—try again. The bot uses background processing. [Open an issue](https://github.com/mezotv/tembo-discord-bot/issues) if it persists.

**Tasks not appearing?** Check you're in the correct account with `/whoami`, verify tasks exist in your dashboard, and ensure your API key has permissions.

**Can't receive DMs?** Check Discord privacy settings allow DMs from server members. If blocked, instructions appear in the channel instead.
