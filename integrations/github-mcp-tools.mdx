# GitHub MCP Tools Access

This document provides information about GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool availability in Tembo's environment.

## MCP Server Configuration

Based on the task metadata, Tembo has MCP server configurations available:
- MCP Server ID: `b76a26cd-cec4-4d28-8c17-7118c0ff3899`
- MCP Executable: Available at `/nix/store/s84hdj0x60kpvz05z6w95km3n6vbglss-tembo-1.0.0/bin/tembo`

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools and services. MCP tools typically:
- Start with the `mcp__` prefix
- Provide specialized functionality for specific services
- Offer enhanced capabilities compared to standard tool implementations

## GitHub Integration Context

Tembo's GitHub integration currently provides:
- Pull request creation and management
- Repository scanning capabilities
- Code analysis features
- Security and performance issue detection

## MCP Tool Detection

MCP-provided tools are prefixed with `mcp__` and are designed to provide enhanced functionality. The system architecture indicates:

1. **Tool Preference**: When MCP-provided tools are available (e.g., `mcp__web_fetch`), they should be preferred over standard implementations as they may have fewer restrictions.

2. **GitHub Operations**: Standard GitHub operations are currently handled through the `gh` CLI tool via Bash commands, which provides:
   - Issue management
   - Pull request operations
   - GitHub API access
   - Repository checks and releases

## Current Capabilities

While direct enumeration of all available MCP tools is not exposed through the standard tool interface, Tembo's environment includes:

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) integration for repository operations
- Environment configured for MCP server connectivity
- Standard tool suite optimized for code analysis and repository management

## Usage Notes

When working with GitHub in Tembo:
- Use `gh` commands via the Bash tool for GitHub-related tasks
- MCP tools, when available, provide enhanced capabilities
- The system automatically selects the most appropriate tool for each operation
