## Menubar Integration

Enable the "Tembo in Menubar" command to see your active tasks at a glance. This provides:

- Quick access to current tasks
- Status indicators for task progress
- Direct links to task details

## Ask Tembo with Raycast AI

Use Raycast's AI features to interact with Tembo naturally:

- "Show me my tasks for this repository"
- "Create a task to fix the login bug"
- "What tasks are currently in progress?"

# Best Practices

## Writing Effective Task Descriptions

When creating tasks through Raycast, provide clear and actionable descriptions:

**Good Examples:**
- "Fix memory leak in background job processor at workers/job-processor.ts"
- "Add email validation to user registration form using RFC 5322 standard"
- "Refactor authentication middleware to use async/await patterns"

**Less Effective:**
- "Fix the bug"
- "Improve performance"
- "Update the code"

See the [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide) for more tips on writing effective task descriptions.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with these Raycast shortcuts:

- `⌘+K` - Open command palette while viewing tasks
- `⌘+Enter` - Create task immediately after entering description
- `⌘+,` - Open extension settings to update API key or preferences
- `⌘+R` - Refresh task list to see latest updates

## Troubleshooting

**Tasks not appearing:**
- Verify your API key is correct in extension settings
- Check that you have the necessary permissions in your Tembo organization
- Try refreshing the task list with `⌘+R`

**Cannot create tasks:**
- Ensure your API key has write permissions
- Verify the selected repository is active in your Tembo dashboard
