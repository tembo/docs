Assign Linear issues to Tembo and turn them into PRs.


# Features

- Assign issues to Tembo or add the "tembo" label to trigger work
- AI-powered code solutions with pull request generation

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Linear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Linear workspace. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Labels">
    Tembo automatically creates a "Tembo Git Repositories" label group with labels for all your GitHub repositories. Each label is prefixed with `tembo/` followed by your repository name (e.g., `tembo/frontend`, `tembo/backend`).

    **Selecting repositories:**
    - Add one or more repository labels to specify which repositories Tembo should work on
    - For multi-repo tasks (e.g., full-stack features), add multiple labels before assigning to Tembo
    - Example: Add both `tembo/frontend` and `tembo/backend` labels for a task that requires changes to both repositories

    **Setting a default repository:**

    If you work primarily in one repository, you can configure a default repository in the [Linear integration settings](https://app.tembo.io/integrations). This eliminates the need to add repository labels to every issue.

    - Navigate to Settings → Integrations → Linear
    - Select your default repository from the dropdown
    - All issues assigned to Tembo without repository labels will use this default

    **Note:** Repository labels on individual issues always take precedence over the default repository setting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment">
    Now you can assign Linear issues to Tembo to trigger solutions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Usage

## Triggering Tembo

There are two ways to trigger Tembo to work on a Linear issue:

### Method 1: Assign to Tembo

Assign the issue directly to Tembo. The bot user should appear in your Linear workspace after completing the integration setup.

### Method 2: Add "tembo" Label

Add the `tembo` label to any issue. This is useful when you want to queue multiple issues or when assignment isn't convenient.

## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed as it works on your Linear issues:

- **Status Changes** - Tembo automatically updates the Linear issue status as it progresses through the task
- **Comments** - Tembo adds comments to the issue with progress updates and links to pull requests
- **Pull Request Links** - When code changes are ready, Tembo comments with a link to the generated PR

## Working with Multiple Repositories

For tasks that span multiple repositories (e.g., full-stack features):

1. Add multiple repository labels to the issue before assigning to Tembo
2. Example: Add both `tembo/frontend` and `tembo/backend` labels
3. Tembo will create separate pull requests for each repository

## Best Practices

**Write clear, actionable issue descriptions:**

Good examples:
- "Add email validation to the user registration form"
- "Fix memory leak in the background job processor"
- "Add pagination to the /api/users endpoint"

Less effective:
- "Fix the bug"
- "Improve performance"
- "Update the app"

**Include relevant context:**
- Add screenshots or error logs to help Tembo understand the issue
- Reference related issues or pull requests
- Specify acceptance criteria in the issue description
