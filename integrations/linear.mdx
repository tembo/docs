Assign Linear issues to Tembo and turn them into PRs.

# Features

- Assign issues to Tembo to trigger work
- AI-powered code solutions with pull request generation
- Interactive repository selection when starting tasks

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Linear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Linear workspace. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Labels">
    Tembo automatically creates a "Tembo Git Repositories" label group with all your GitHub repositories. Use these labels to specify which repository Tembo should target for each issue.

    You can set a default repository to avoid adding labels to every issue.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Using Tembo">
    Now you can assign Linear issues to Tembo to trigger solutions.

# Supported Triggers

Tembo maps Linear activity to automation triggers (use a `linear.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `issue.created`
- `issue.updated`
- `issue.labeled`
- `issue.assigned`
- `comment.created`

See Automations for how to create triggers from these events.

# Usage

## Triggering Tembo

Assign the issue directly to Tembo. The bot user should appear in your Linear workspace after completing the integration setup.

## Repository Selection

When you assign a Linear issue to Tembo, you'll be prompted to select which repository to work on:

1. **Assign the issue** - Assign the Linear issue to Tembo
2. **Select repository** - Tembo will present you with a dropdown menu of available repositories
3. **Choose your repository** - Select one repository from the list, or type to select multiple repositories
4. **Tembo starts work** - Once you've made your selection, Tembo will automatically begin working on the task

### Working with Multiple Repositories

For tasks that span multiple repositories (e.g., full-stack features):

1. When prompted for repository selection, type the names of multiple repositories
2. Example: Type "frontend backend" or select both repositories
3. Tembo will create separate pull requests for each repository and coordinate changes across all selected repositories

## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed as it works on your Linear issues:

- **Interactive Prompts** - Tembo will ask you to select a repository and confirm before starting work
- **Progress Updates** - Tembo provides real-time updates as it works through the task
- **Status Changes** - Tembo automatically updates the Linear issue status as it progresses through the task
- **Comments** - Tembo adds comments to the issue with progress updates and links to pull requests
- **Pull Request Links** - When code changes are ready, Tembo comments with a link to the generated PR

## Best Practices

**Write clear, actionable issue descriptions:**

Good examples:
- "Add email validation to the user registration form"
- "Fix memory leak in the background job processor"
- "Add pagination to the /api/users endpoint"

Less effective:
- "Fix the bug"
- "Improve performance"
- "Update the app"

**Include relevant context:**
- Add screenshots or error logs to help Tembo understand the issue
- Reference related issues or pull requests
- Specify acceptance criteria in the issue description

**Choose the right repositories:**
- Select all repositories that need changes for the task
- For full-stack features, include both frontend and backend repositories
- If unsure, start with one repository and Tembo can help identify if others are needed

# MCP Server Integration

Tembo provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for Linear, enabling AI coding agents to directly interact with your Linear workspace during task execution.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI applications to connect to external data sources and tools. With MCP, agents can query Linear issues, retrieve project information, and access workspace data in real-time while solving problems.

## Using the Linear MCP Server

When you connect Linear to Tembo, the MCP server is automatically available to agents working on your tasks. Agents can:

- **Query issues** - Search and filter Linear issues programmatically
- **Access issue details** - Retrieve full issue context, including descriptions, comments, and status
- **Read project information** - Access project and team data for better context
- **Track issue status** - Monitor issue state changes and updates

This enables agents to make more informed decisions when working on Linear issues, as they have direct access to your project management data and can reference related issues and context while implementing solutions.
