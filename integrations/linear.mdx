Assign Linear issues to Tembo and turn them into PRs.

# Features

- Assign issues to Tembo to trigger work
- AI-powered code solutions with pull request generation
- Interactive repository selection when starting tasks

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Linear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Linear workspace. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Labels">
    Tembo automatically creates a "Tembo Git Repositories" label group with all your GitHub repositories. Use these labels to specify which repository Tembo should target for each issue.

    You can set a default repository to avoid adding labels to every issue.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Using Tembo">
    Now you can assign Linear issues to Tembo to trigger solutions.
  </Step>

# Supported Triggers

Tembo maps Linear activity to automation triggers (use a `linear.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `issue.created`
- `issue.updated`
- `issue.labeled`
- `issue.assigned`
- `comment.created`

See Automations for how to create triggers from these events.

# Usage

## Triggering Tembo

Assign the issue directly to Tembo. The bot user should appear in your Linear workspace after completing the integration setup.

## Repository Selection

When you assign a Linear issue to Tembo, you'll be prompted to select which repository to work on:

1. **Assign the issue** - Assign the Linear issue to Tembo
2. **Select repository** - Tembo will present you with a dropdown menu of available repositories
3. **Choose your repository** - Select one repository from the list, or type to select multiple repositories
4. **Tembo starts work** - Once you've made your selection, Tembo will automatically begin working on the task

### Working with Multiple Repositories

For tasks that span multiple repositories (e.g., full-stack features):

1. When prompted for repository selection, type the names of multiple repositories
2. Example: Type "frontend backend" or select both repositories
3. Tembo will create separate pull requests for each repository and coordinate changes across all selected repositories

## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed as it works on your Linear issues:

- **Interactive Prompts** - Tembo will ask you to select a repository and confirm before starting work
- **Progress Updates** - Tembo provides real-time updates as it works through the task
- **Status Changes** - Tembo automatically updates the Linear issue status as it progresses through the task
- **Comments** - Tembo adds comments to the issue with progress updates and links to pull requests
- **Pull Request Links** - When code changes are ready, Tembo comments with a link to the generated PR

## Best Practices

**Write clear, actionable issue descriptions:**

Good examples:
- "Add email validation to the user registration form"
- "Fix memory leak in the background job processor"
- "Add pagination to the /api/users endpoint"

Less effective:
- "Fix the bug"
- "Improve performance"
- "Update the app"

**Include relevant context:**
- Add screenshots or error logs to help Tembo understand the issue
- Reference related issues or pull requests
- Specify acceptance criteria in the issue description

**Choose the right repositories:**
- Select all repositories that need changes for the task
- For full-stack features, include both frontend and backend repositories
- If unsure, start with one repository and Tembo can help identify if others are needed
