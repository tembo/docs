Assign Linear issues to Tembo and turn them into PRs.


# Features

- Assign issues to Tembo or add the "tembo" label to trigger work
- AI-powered code solutions with pull request generation

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Linear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Linear workspace. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Labels">
    Tembo automatically creates a "Tembo Git Repositories" label group with labels for all your GitHub repositories. Each label is prefixed with `tembo/` followed by your repository name (e.g., `tembo/frontend`, `tembo/backend`).

    **Selecting repositories:**
    - Add one or more repository labels to specify which repositories Tembo should work on
    - For multi-repo tasks (e.g., full-stack features), add multiple labels before assigning to Tembo
    - Example: Add both `tembo/frontend` and `tembo/backend` labels for a task that requires changes to both repositories

    **Default repository:**
    You can set a default repository in your settings to avoid adding labels to every issue when working primarily in one repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment">
    Now you can assign Linear issues to Tembo to trigger solutions.
  </Step>
</Steps> 

# Supported Triggers

Tembo maps Linear activity to workflow triggers (use a `linear.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`). Common trigger sources include:

- Issue assignment to Tembo
- Adding repository labels (e.g., `tembo/<repo>` or `tembo/auto`)
- Label changes related to repository selection

See Workflow Automations for how to create triggers from these events.
