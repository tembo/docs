Assign Jira tickets to Tembo and turn them into PRs.

# Features

- Add the "Tembo" label to issues to trigger analysis
- Use `tembo/{repo-name}` labels to target specific repositories
- Click provided links to view coding sessions and create PRs

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Tembo Account">
    Create a dedicated Jira account for Tembo using either an email alias
    (`youremail+tembo@company.com`) or a dedicated email (`tembo@company.com`).
    Invite this account to your Jira workspace and complete the sign-up process
    using the name "Tembo".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in
    Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Jira. Make sure you're logged
    into the Tembo Jira account (not your personal account) when completing this
    step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Labels">
    Create a "Tembo" label in your Jira project if it doesn't exist:

    1. Navigate to your Jira project settings by clicking the gear icon in the project sidebar
    2. Select "Labels" from the project settings menu
    3. Click "Create label" and enter "Tembo" as the label name
    4. Save the label

    Once created, add this label to any issue you want Tembo to analyze and work on by editing the issue and selecting the "Tembo" label.

  <Step title="Start Sessions">
    After labeling tickets, Tembo will comment with analysis and provide a link
    to view the session.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Supported Triggers

Tembo maps Jira activity to automation triggers (use a `jira.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `issue.created`
- `issue.updated`
- `issue.labeled`
- `issue.assigned`
- `issue.addedToBoard` - Triggers when an issue moves to a specific board or status column. Filter by project, board, or status.
- `transition.changed`
- `comment.created`

See Automations for how to create triggers from these events.

# Usage

## Triggering Tembo

Add the "Tembo" label to any Jira issue you want Tembo to work on. Once labeled, Tembo will:

1. **Analyze the issue** - Review the issue description, acceptance criteria, and any attached context
2. **Create a coding session** - Generate a solution based on the issue requirements
3. **Comment with updates** - Provide progress updates and a link to view the session
4. **Create pull requests** - Submit code changes as pull requests when ready

## Targeting a Repository

To specify which repository Tembo should work in, add a label with the format `tembo/{repo-name}`. For example, `tembo/frontend` targets your "frontend" repository. When multiple `tembo/` labels are present, Tembo uses the first matching enabled repository.

## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed as it works on your Jira issues:

- **Comments** - Tembo adds comments to the issue with progress updates and links to coding sessions
- **Pull Request Links** - When code changes are ready, Tembo comments with links to generated pull requests
- **Session Links** - View detailed coding sessions to see how Tembo approached the problem

## Troubleshooting

**Tembo not responding to labeled issues?** Verify the label is exactly "Tembo" (case-sensitive), confirm you installed using the dedicated Tembo Jira account, check Tembo has permission to read/comment, and verify the integration is active on the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations).

**Issues not being processed?** Ensure GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket is connected, include clear descriptions with acceptance criteria, and verify `issue.labeled` webhook is enabled.

## Best Practices

- **Write clear issue descriptions** - Include detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and context to help Tembo understand the task
- **Use acceptance criteria** - Define specific, measurable criteria so Tembo knows when the work is complete
- **Attach relevant context** - Include screenshots, error logs, or links to related issues when applicable
- **Use [Rule Files](/features/rule-files)** - Help Tembo understand your coding standards and project conventions
- **Set up [Hooks](/features/hooks)** - Customize Tembo's behavior to match your team's workflow
