Connect AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases to Tembo for performance monitoring and optimization.

# Features

- **Monitor slow queries** - Identifies queries that exceed performance thresholds and suggests optimizations
- **Detect missing indexes** - Analyzes query patterns to find opportunities for new indexes that would improve performance
- **Detect unused indexes** - Identifies indexes that are no longer being used, helping reduce storage overhead and write performance impact
- **Automatic optimization PRs** - Generates pull requests with database migration scripts to implement recommended improvements
- **Multi-region support** - Automatically discovers RDS instances across multiple AWS regions

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect AWS Account">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in
    Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to AWS. You'll be redirected to
    AWS CloudFormation to create a connection using a secure IAM role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy CloudFormation Stack">
    Follow the CloudFormation wizard to deploy the connection stack. This creates
    an IAM role that allows Tembo to discover and monitor your RDS instances securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate RDS Instances">
    After the connection is established, Tembo will automatically discover your
    RDS PostgreSQL instances across supported regions. Select which instances
    you want to monitor under "Active Instances" on the Integrations page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Repository">
    Map your RDS instances to the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository where
    your database migrations are stored. This allows Tembo to create PRs with
    optimization suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Usage

Once connected, Tembo continuously monitors your RDS PostgreSQL instances for slow queries, missing indexes, and unused indexes using PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` extension. When optimization opportunities are identified, Tembo creates pull requests with database migration scripts, detailed explanations, and performance metrics.

## Troubleshooting

### RDS Instances Not Appearing

If your RDS instances don't appear after connecting:

1. **Wait for discovery** - Initial discovery can take a few minutes as Tembo scans multiple AWS regions
2. **Check CloudFormation stack** - Verify the stack deployed successfully in your AWS console
3. **Verify IAM permissions** - Ensure the IAM role has permission to describe RDS instances
4. **Check instance type** - Only PostgreSQL RDS instances are supported

### Optimization PRs Not Being Created

If Tembo isn't creating optimization PRs:

1. **Verify repository mapping** - Ensure your RDS instance is mapped to the correct repository
2. **Check pg_stat_statements** - The extension must be enabled for query analysis
3. **Review monitoring period** - Tembo needs time to collect query statistics before suggesting optimizations
4. **Check branch permissions** - Ensure Tembo has permission to create branches in your repository

### Connection Issues

If Tembo cannot connect to your RDS instance:

1. **Security groups** - Verify the RDS security group allows connections from Tembo's IP ranges
2. **VPC configuration** - Ensure your RDS instance is accessible (public or via VPN/Direct Connect)
3. **SSL/TLS settings** - Confirm SSL settings match your RDS configuration

## Best Practices

- Connect production databases for accurate insights; test migrations in staging first
- Review all suggested migrations before merging, especially for large tables
- Ensure `pg_stat_statements` is enabled for comprehensive query analysis
