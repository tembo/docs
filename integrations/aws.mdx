</Note>

Connect AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases to Tembo for performance monitoring and optimization.

# Features

- **Monitor slow queries** - Identifies queries that exceed performance thresholds and suggests optimizations
- **Detect missing indexes** - Analyzes query patterns to find opportunities for new indexes that would improve performance
- **Detect unused indexes** - Identifies indexes that are no longer being used, helping reduce storage overhead and write performance impact
- **Automatic optimization PRs** - Generates pull requests with database migration scripts to implement recommended improvements
- **Multi-region support** - Automatically discovers RDS instances across multiple AWS regions

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect AWS Account">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in
    Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to AWS. You'll be redirected to
    AWS CloudFormation to create a connection using a secure IAM role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy CloudFormation Stack">
    Follow the CloudFormation wizard to deploy the connection stack. This creates
    an IAM role that allows Tembo to discover and monitor your RDS instances securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate RDS Instances">
    After the connection is established, Tembo will automatically discover your
    RDS PostgreSQL instances across supported regions. Select which instances
    you want to monitor under "Active Instances" on the Integrations page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Repository">
    Map your RDS instances to the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository where
    your database migrations are stored. This allows Tembo to create PRs with
    optimization suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Usage

Once connected, Tembo continuously monitors your RDS PostgreSQL instances for slow queries, missing indexes, and unused indexes using PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` extension. When optimization opportunities are identified, Tembo creates pull requests with database migration scripts, detailed explanations, and performance metrics.

## Best Practices

- **Secure IAM Role** - The CloudFormation template creates a least-privilege IAM role for Tembo
- **Monitor Production Databases** - Connect production RDS instances for the most accurate performance insights
- **Review Migration Scripts** - Always review Tembo's suggested migrations before merging, especially for large tables
- **Test in Staging** - Apply migrations to a staging environment first to verify performance improvements
- **Enable pg_stat_statements** - Ensure the `pg_stat_statements` extension is enabled on your RDS instances for comprehensive query analysis
