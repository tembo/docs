Integrations connect Tembo to your existing development tools. Each integration brings a combination of standardized capabilities — connection flow, webhook event handling, MCP server access, workflow triggers, and more — that allow Tembo's coding agents to interact with external services on your behalf.

All integrations are managed from the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in your Tembo dashboard.

# What integrations contain

Every integration is built from the same set of standardized components. Not all integrations include every component — the table below describes what each one provides.

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Connection flow** | Secure authentication flow that connects your account without exposing credentials. Handles token exchange, refresh, and scope management. |
| **Webhooks** | Real-time event listeners that receive notifications from external services (e.g., a new issue created, a PR merged) and route them into Tembo. |
| **Triggers** | Named events (e.g., `github.pull_request.opened`) that can start [Automations](/features/automations). Each trigger maps to a specific webhook event and can include filters. |
| **MCP Server** | A [Model Context Protocol](/features/mcp-servers) server that gives coding agents direct access to the integration's API — querying issues, reading data, managing resources — while working on tasks. |
| **Git Provider** | Repository operations for source control integrations: cloning, branching, committing, and opening pull requests. |

# Available integrations

## Source Control

Connect your repositories so Tembo can scan code, open pull requests, and respond to review feedback.

| Integration | Connection flow | Webhooks | Triggers | MCP | Git |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [GitHub](/integrations/github) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [GitLab](/integrations/gitlab) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Bitbucket](/integrations/bitbucket) | Yes | Yes | — | — | Yes |

## Work Collaboration

Assign tasks from project management and communication tools to trigger coding agents.

| Integration | Connection flow | Webhooks | Triggers | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Slack](/integrations/slack) | Yes | Yes | — | Yes |
| [Linear](/integrations/linear) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Jira](/integrations/jira) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Notion](/integrations/notion) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Monitoring

Detect production errors and automatically generate fixes.

| Integration | Connection flow | Webhooks | Triggers | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Sentry](/integrations/sentry) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Database Providers

Monitor database performance and generate optimization pull requests.

| Integration | Connection flow | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Postgres](/integrations/postgres) | — | Yes |
| [Supabase](/integrations/supabase) | Yes | — |
| [AWS RDS](/integrations/aws) | — | — |

## Other

| Integration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Raycast](/integrations/raycast) | Trigger Tembo tasks from Raycast on macOS |
| [Discord](/integrations/discord) | Connect your Discord server to Tembo |

# Installing an integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Open the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in your Tembo dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install or Connect">
    Click the **Install** or **Connect** button next to the integration you want to add. Connection flow integrations redirect you to the external service to authorize access. Non-OAuth integrations (like Postgres) ask for connection details directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    After connecting, configure integration-specific settings such as active repositories, project mappings, or default preferences. Each integration's documentation page covers its specific configuration steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# MCP servers from integrations

When you connect certain integrations, [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers) become automatically available to your coding agents. This means agents can query issues, read documentation, check error details, or run database queries in real-time while working on tasks — without any additional configuration.

Integrations that provide MCP servers: **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Slack**, **Linear**, **Jira**, **Sentry**, **Notion**, and **Postgres**.

# Automation triggers

Integrations that support triggers let you build [Automations](/features/automations) that start coding agents in response to external events. For example, you can configure an automation that runs when a GitHub issue is opened, a Sentry error is detected, or a Linear issue is assigned to Tembo.

Each integration's documentation page lists its supported trigger events and naming conventions (e.g., `github.pull_request.opened`, `sentry.issue.created`, `linear.issue.assigned`).

# Managing installed integrations

You can manage your installed integrations from the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations):

- **Disconnect** — Remove an integration by clicking the disconnect or uninstall button. This revokes Tembo's access to the external service.

# FAQ

## Can I connect multiple accounts for the same integration?

Each integration supports one connection per organization. If you need to connect multiple GitHub organizations, for example, install the GitHub App with access to all the organizations you need.

## Do integrations have access to all my data?

Integrations only access data you explicitly authorize. For connection flow integrations, you choose the scope during installation. For source control integrations, you select which repositories Tembo can access. Database integrations use read-only access by default.

## What happens if I disconnect an integration?

Disconnecting an integration revokes Tembo's access to the external service. Active automations that depend on the integration's triggers will stop firing. Previously created pull requests and issues are not affected.
