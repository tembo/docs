Connect Sentry to Tembo for automatic error detection and code fixes. When Sentry detects an error in your application, Tembo analyzes the stack trace and creates a pull request with a targeted fix.

# Features

- **Automatic error monitoring** - Detects new errors as they occur in your production environment
- **Stack trace analysis** - Analyzes error context, breadcrumbs, and related data to understand root causes
- **Intelligent fixes** - Generates pull requests with code changes that address the specific error
- **Webhook-driven** - Responds immediately when Sentry reports new issues

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to Sentry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Sentry account with permissions to read error data and receive webhook events. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when authorization is complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Projects">
    Map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories under "Projects" on the Integrations page.

    Only mapped projects will generate pull requests with code fixes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to Sentry issue lifecycle events and maps them to automation triggers (reference them as `sentry.<event>` in your `triggerName`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `issue.created`
- `issue.regression`
- `issue.resolved`
- `issue.ignored`
- `issue.assigned`

See Automations for creating triggers from these events.

# How It Works

1. **Error Detected** - Sentry captures an error in your application and sends a webhook to Tembo
2. **Analysis** - Tembo retrieves the full error context, including stack traces, breadcrumbs, and environment details
3. **Solution Generation** - Tembo analyzes your codebase and creates an appropriate fix
4. **Pull Request** - A PR is automatically opened in your repository with the fix and context
5. **Review & Iterate** - Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to refine the solution if needed

# Best Practices

## Project Mapping

- Map Sentry projects to the repositories where the errors actually occur
- For monorepos, you may need multiple Sentry projects mapped to the same repository
- Verify mappings are correct to ensure fixes target the right codebase

## Error Context

To help Tembo generate better fixes:

- Configure Sentry to capture comprehensive stack traces
- Enable source maps for minified JavaScript/TypeScript
- Include relevant tags and custom context in your Sentry configuration
- Set up breadcrumbs to track user actions leading to errors

## Reviewing Auto-Generated Fixes

- Always review PRs before merging - Tembo provides solutions, you decide what gets deployed
- Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to request improvements by tagging `@tembo` in PR comments
- Test the fix in a staging environment before deploying to production

# MCP Server Integration

When you connect Sentry to Tembo, an [MCP server](/features/mcp-servers) is automatically available to agents. Agents can query error data, retrieve stack traces, check issue status, and analyze error trends in real-time while fixing bugs.

# Troubleshooting

### Errors Not Triggering Fixes

If Sentry errors aren't generating pull requests with fixes:

1. **Check project mapping** - Verify the Sentry project is mapped to the correct GitHub repository on the Integrations page
2. **Verify webhook status** - Ensure the Sentry webhook is properly configured and receiving events
3. **Review error frequency** - Tembo may deduplicate fixes for errors that have already been addressed
4. **Check error context** - Ensure Sentry is capturing sufficient stack trace information for Tembo to analyze

### Project Mapping Issues

If you're having trouble mapping Sentry projects to repositories:

1. **Refresh project list** - Use the sync button on the Integrations page to refresh Sentry projects
2. **Verify permissions** - Ensure Tembo has access to the Sentry projects you want to map
3. **Check organization access** - Confirm the Sentry organization is properly connected

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

If Tembo isn't receiving Sentry webhooks:

1. **Verify integration status** - Check the Integrations page to confirm Sentry is connected
2. **Test with a new error** - Trigger a test error to verify the webhook pipeline
3. **Review Sentry settings** - Ensure webhooks are enabled for your Sentry organization
