# MCP Server Integration

Tembo provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for Sentry, enabling AI coding agents to directly interact with your Sentry data during task execution.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI applications to connect to external data sources and tools. With MCP, agents can query Sentry error data, retrieve stack traces, and access issue details in real-time while solving problems.

## Using the Sentry MCP Server

When you connect Sentry to Tembo, the MCP server is automatically available to agents working on your tasks. Agents can:

- **Query error data** - Search and filter Sentry issues programmatically
- **Retrieve stack traces** - Access detailed error information for debugging
- **Check issue status** - Verify if errors are resolved or still occurring
- **Analyze error trends** - Understand error patterns and frequency

This enables agents to make more informed decisions when fixing bugs, as they have direct access to production error data and can verify their fixes against actual error conditions.
