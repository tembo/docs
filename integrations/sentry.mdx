# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

When Sentry is connected, Tembo agents automatically gain access to the Sentry MCP server. This provides agents with enhanced capabilities to:

- Query error and issue data directly from Sentry
- Analyze stack traces and error patterns
- Access monitoring data for better context when fixing bugs

The MCP integration is automatically enabled when you connect Sentry - no additional configuration required.
