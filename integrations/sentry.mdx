# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

When Sentry is connected, Tembo automatically provides access to a Sentry MCP server during task execution. This gives AI agents the ability to:

- Query issues and errors in real-time
- Access detailed error information, stack traces, and event context
- Retrieve monitoring data and performance metrics
- Make informed decisions based on current Sentry data

The MCP server is automatically configured and available to agents working on tasks related to your connected repositories. This enables agents to access up-to-date error information directly from Sentry while generating fixes, without requiring manual data gathering.
