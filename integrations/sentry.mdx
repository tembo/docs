# Usage

## How It Works

Once connected, Tembo monitors your Sentry projects for errors:

1. **Error Detection** - When a new error is detected in Sentry, Tembo receives a webhook notification
2. **Stack Trace Analysis** - Tembo analyzes the error message, stack trace, and related context
3. **Code Investigation** - Tembo examines the relevant code in your repository to understand the root cause
4. **Fix Generation** - A pull request is automatically created with a proposed fix for the issue
5. **Review & Merge** - Review the fix in your normal PR workflow, provide feedback if needed, and merge when ready

## What Gets Fixed

Tembo can automatically address common error patterns including:

- **Null/undefined reference errors** - Missing null checks, optional chaining opportunities
- **Type errors** - Type mismatches, incorrect function signatures
- **Logic errors** - Off-by-one errors, incorrect conditionals
- **API errors** - Incorrect API usage, missing error handling
- **Configuration errors** - Environment variable issues, missing config values

## Best Practices

**Keep your Sentry projects organized:**
- Map each Sentry project to the correct GitHub repository
- Use consistent naming between Sentry and GitHub for easier management
- Ensure error grouping in Sentry is configured appropriately

**Write helpful error messages:**
- Include context in your error logs to help Tembo understand the issue
- Add relevant variables and state information when logging errors
- Use structured logging when possible

**Review fixes carefully:**
- While Tembo's fixes are generally accurate, always review the changes
- Provide feedback through PR comments if the fix needs adjustments
- Merge fixes promptly to resolve production issues quickly
