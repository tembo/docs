# Usage

## How It Works

When Sentry detects an error in your application:

1. **Error Detection** - Sentry captures the error and sends a webhook notification to Tembo
2. **Analysis** - Tembo analyzes the stack trace, error context, and related code
3. **Solution Generation** - An AI agent generates a fix based on the error details
4. **Pull Request** - Tembo creates a PR with the proposed fix in your mapped repository

## Best Practices

**Map projects accurately:**
- Ensure each Sentry project is mapped to the correct GitHub repository
- For monorepos, map multiple Sentry projects to the same repository if needed

**Provide clear error context:**
- Use Sentry's breadcrumbs and custom context to give Tembo more information
- Include relevant tags and user feedback when available

**Review before merging:**
- While Tembo aims for accurate fixes, always review auto-generated PRs
- Use your existing code review process and CI/CD pipeline to validate changes
