Connect Sentry to Tembo for automatic error detection and code fixes.

# Features

- Monitors errors and analyzes stack traces in real-time
- Generates pull requests with specific code fixes for detected issues
- Auto-fixes bugs in your codebase as soon as they're detected
- Reduces time from error detection to resolution

# How It Works

Once connected, Tembo monitors your Sentry projects for new errors. When an error is detected:

1. Tembo analyzes the stack trace and error context
2. Identifies the root cause in your codebase
3. Generates a fix and creates a pull request
4. Notifies your team for review

This happens automatically - no manual intervention needed.

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to Sentry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Sentry account with permissions to read error data and receive webhook events. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Projects">
    Map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories under "Projects" on the Integrations page.

    Only mapped projects will generate pull requests with code fixes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Monitoring">
    Once mapped, Tembo immediately begins monitoring for new errors. When errors are detected, pull requests will be created automatically in the mapped repositories.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Tembo responds to errors as they occur in real-time. For high-priority production issues, pull requests are typically created within minutes of error detection.
