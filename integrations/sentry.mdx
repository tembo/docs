Connect Sentry to Tembo for automatic error detection and code fixes.

# Features

- Monitor errors and analyzes stack traces
- Generate pull requests with specific code fixes
- Auto-fix issues in your codebase
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) support** - Agents can directly query Sentry data during task execution

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to Sentry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Sentry account with permissions to read error data and receive webhook events. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Projects">
    Map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories under "Projects" on the Integrations page.

    Only mapped projects will generate pull requests with code fixes.

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Sentry integration includes MCP server support, which provides AI agents with direct access to your Sentry data during task execution.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI agents to interact with external data sources. When enabled, agents working on your tasks can:

- Query error details, stack traces, and event data from Sentry
- Access issue metadata, tags, and user impact information
- Retrieve monitoring data to understand error patterns
- Make more informed decisions when fixing bugs

## How it Works

When an agent is working on a task related to a Sentry error:

1. The agent automatically gets access to a Sentry MCP server
2. The server is authenticated with your Sentry integration credentials
3. The agent can query Sentry data directly without manual intervention
4. This enables deeper context and more accurate fixes

## Benefits

- **Richer Context**: Agents can access complete error information including stack traces, breadcrumbs, and user context
- **Faster Resolution**: Direct access to Sentry data eliminates the need for manual error investigation
- **Better Fixes**: Agents can analyze error patterns and frequency to create more comprehensive solutions
- **Automatic**: No additional configuration required - MCP is enabled automatically when you connect Sentry

<Note>
MCP support is automatically enabled when you connect your Sentry integration. No additional setup is required.
