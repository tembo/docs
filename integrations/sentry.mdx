Connect Sentry to Tembo for automatic error detection and code fixes.

# Features

- Monitor errors and analyze stack traces in real-time
- Generate pull requests with specific code fixes
- Auto-fix issues in your codebase as they occur
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for production errors

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to Sentry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Sentry account with permissions to read error data and receive webhook events. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Projects">
    Map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories under "Projects" on the Integrations page.

    Only mapped projects will generate pull requests with code fixes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# How it Works

Once configured, Tembo continuously monitors your Sentry projects for new errors:

1. **Error Detection** - When Sentry captures an error, Tembo receives a notification
2. **Stack Trace Analysis** - Tembo analyzes the stack trace to identify the root cause
3. **Code Investigation** - The agent examines the relevant code in your repository
4. **Solution Generation** - A fix is developed based on the error context and code analysis
5. **Pull Request Creation** - Tembo opens a PR with the proposed fix for your review

## Project Mapping

Mapping your Sentry projects to repositories is essential for Tembo to:

- Locate the correct codebase for error resolution
- Create pull requests in the appropriate repository
- Understand your project structure and dependencies

**To map a project:**
1. Go to the Integrations page and find your Sentry integration
2. Click on "Projects" to view all available Sentry projects
3. For each project, select the corresponding GitHub repository from the dropdown
4. Save your mappings

# Best Practices

**Map projects accurately:**
- Ensure each Sentry project is mapped to the correct repository
- For monorepos, map all relevant Sentry projects to the same repository
- Verify mappings after setup by triggering a test error

**Review pull requests promptly:**
- Tembo's fixes are generated based on stack traces and code analysis
- Review the proposed changes to ensure they address the root cause
- Use the [feedback loop](/features/feedback-loop) to refine solutions if needed

**Monitor error patterns:**
- Similar errors may indicate systemic issues worth addressing
- Use Sentry's grouping features to track related errors
- Consider broader refactoring for frequently occurring error patterns
