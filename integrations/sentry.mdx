# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to Sentry issue lifecycle events and maps them to workflow triggers (reference them as `sentry.<event>` in your `triggerName`). Common events include:

- New issue created
- Issue regression
- Issue resolved/ignored

See Workflow Automations for creating triggers from these events.
