Connect Sentry to Tembo for automatic error detection and code fixes. When Sentry detects an error in your application, Tembo analyzes the stack trace and creates a pull request with a targeted fix.

# Features

- **Automatic error monitoring** - Detects new errors as they occur in your production environment
- **Stack trace analysis** - Analyzes error context, breadcrumbs, and related data to understand root causes
- **Intelligent fixes** - Generates pull requests with code changes that address the specific error
- **Webhook-driven** - Responds immediately when Sentry reports new issues

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Connect` button next to Sentry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Sentry account with permissions to read error data and receive webhook events. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when authorization is complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Projects">
    Map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories under "Projects" on the Integrations page.

    Only mapped projects will generate pull requests with code fixes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to Sentry issue lifecycle events and maps them to automation triggers (reference them as `sentry.<event>` in your `triggerName`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `issue.created`
- `issue.regression`
- `issue.resolved`
- `issue.ignored`
- `issue.assigned`

See Automations for creating triggers from these events.

# How It Works

1. **Error Detected** - Sentry captures an error in your application and sends a webhook to Tembo
2. **Analysis** - Tembo retrieves the full error context, including stack traces, breadcrumbs, and environment details
3. **Solution Generation** - Tembo analyzes your codebase and creates an appropriate fix
4. **Pull Request** - A PR is automatically opened in your repository with the fix and context
5. **Review & Iterate** - Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to refine the solution if needed

# Best Practices

- **Map accurately** — Connect Sentry projects to the repositories where errors occur; verify mappings for monorepos
- **Capture context** — Enable comprehensive stack traces, source maps, breadcrumbs, and custom tags in Sentry
- **Review PRs** — Always review before merging; use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to iterate; test in staging first

# MCP Server Integration

When you connect Sentry to Tembo, an [MCP server](/features/mcp-servers) is automatically available to agents. Agents can query error data, retrieve stack traces, check issue status, and analyze error trends in real-time while fixing bugs.

# Troubleshooting

**Errors not triggering fixes?** Check project mapping on the Integrations page, verify webhooks are receiving events, and ensure Sentry captures sufficient stack trace info. Tembo may deduplicate fixes for already-addressed errors.

**Project mapping issues?** Use the sync button to refresh projects, verify Tembo has access to the projects, and confirm the Sentry organization is connected.

**Webhook not receiving events?** Verify integration status on the Integrations page, trigger a test error to check the pipeline, and ensure webhooks are enabled in Sentry settings.
