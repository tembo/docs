```
@tembo [your task description]
```

**Example:**

@tembo Fix the authentication bug in the login flow
```

## Use Different Agent, Repository, or Branch

For a single task, you can specify different parameters:

```
@tembo [branch=dev, agent=claudeCode:claude-4-sonnet, repo=torvalds/linux] [your task description]
```

**Example:**
```
@tembo [branch=feature/auth, repo=myorg/webapp] Add password strength validation
```

### Available Parameters:
- `branch=` - Target branch for the PR (e.g., `branch=dev`, `branch=feature/auth`)
- `agent=` - Specify which Tembo agent to use (e.g., `agent=claudeCode:claude-4-sonnet`)

## Working in Direct Messages

Tembo works seamlessly in private DMs, allowing you to:
- Create personal development tasks without sharing with your team
- Receive private notifications about task progress
- Review completed tasks before sharing results

## Task Execution

Tembo tasks will be executed in the background, and you'll be notified when they're completed. This means:
- You can continue working while Tembo handles your task
- Multiple tasks can run simultaneously
- You'll receive updates when tasks finish with PR summaries
