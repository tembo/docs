    | `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels for context |
    | `channels:read` | Access basic channel information |
    | `chat:write` | Send messages and status updates |
    | `commands` | Handle slash commands |
    | `files:write` | Share diff images and code snippets |
    | `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels for context |
    | `groups:read` | Access private channel information |
    | `im:history` | Read direct messages for context |
    | `im:read` | Access direct message information |
    | `im:write` | Send direct messages |
    | `mpim:history` | Read group direct messages for context |
    | `mpim:read` | Access group direct message information |
    | `mpim:write` | Send group direct messages |
    | `reactions:write` | Add status indicators to messages |
    | `users:read` | Access user information for personalization |

    You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when authorization is complete.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Repositories">
    Ensure you have connected your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories to Tembo first, as these will be available for selection in Slack commands.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Preferences">
    After installation, you can select a default repository for Slack tasks.

# Usage

## Basic Commands

### Start a Background Agent

```
@tembo [your task description]
```

**Example:**

```
@tembo Fix the authentication bug in the login flow
```

## Advanced Command Options

Tembo supports flexible command syntax with multiple options. You can use either bracket format or inline format:

### Bracket Format

```
@tembo [option1=value1, option2=value2] [your task description]
```

**Example:**

```
@tembo [branch=dev, repo=owner/webapp, agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet] Add password strength validation
```

### Available Options

- **`branch=`** - Specify the base branch for the PR

  - Example: `branch=main`, `branch=develop`, `branch=feature/auth`

- **`repo=`** - Target a specific repository

  - Example: `repo=owner/repository`, `repo=myorg/webapp`

- **`agent=`** - Specify which AI agent and model to use (format: `agentType:model`)
  - Example: `agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`, `agent=codex:gpt-5-medium`
  - Supported agents: `claudeCode`, `codex`, `opencode`, `amp`, `cursor`
  - If no agent is specified, defaults to `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
  - See [Agents documentation](/features/agents) for all available options

### Thread Context Utilization

When you mention `@tembo` in a thread, the agent automatically:

- Reads the entire conversation history
- Understands the context from previous messages
- Incorporates team discussions into the solution

# Supported Triggers

Tembo reacts to Slack interactions and maps them to automation triggers (use a `slack.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`, e.g., `slack.app_mention`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `app_mention`
- `slash_command`
- `message_action`
- `thread_reply`

See Automations for how to create triggers from Slack events.
## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed throughout the task lifecycle:

**Reaction indicators on your message:**
- 👀 **Eyes** - Task received and processing
- ✅ **Check mark** - Task completed successfully
- ❌ **X mark** - Task failed or encountered an error

**Direct messages for longer tasks:**
- Progress updates as the agent works
- Pull request links when code changes are ready
- Error details if the task cannot be completed

**Channel updates when complete:**
- Links to generated pull requests with summary of changes

## Best Practices

**Write clear, specific task descriptions:**

Good examples:
```
@tembo Add error handling to the user registration endpoint
@tembo Optimize the product search query by adding an index on the name column
```

Less effective:
```
@tembo Fix the bug
@tembo Make it faster
```

**Use threads for collaboration:**
1. Team discusses the problem and potential approaches in a thread
2. When ready, mention `@tembo` with the final task description
3. Tembo reads the full thread context and incorporates the discussion
