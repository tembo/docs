# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Slack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Slack Permissions">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Slack workspace. The bot requires the following permissions:

    | Permission | Purpose |
    |------------|---------|
    | `app_mentions:read` | Detect when users mention @tembo |
    | `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels for context |
    | `channels:read` | Access basic channel information |
    | `chat:write` | Send messages and status updates |
    | `commands` | Handle slash commands |
    | `files:write` | Share diff images and code snippets |
    | `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels for context |
    | `groups:read` | Access private channel information |
    | `im:history` | Read direct messages for context |
    | `im:read` | Access direct message information |
    | `im:write` | Send direct messages |
    | `mpim:history` | Read group direct messages for context |
    | `mpim:read` | Access group direct message information |
    | `mpim:write` | Send group direct messages |
    | `reactions:write` | Add status indicators to messages |
    | `users:read` | Access user information for personalization |

    You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when authorization is complete.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Repositories">
    Ensure you have connected your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories to Tembo first, as these will be available for selection in Slack commands.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Preferences">
    After installation, you can select a default repository for Slack tasks.

# Usage

## Basic Commands

### Start a Background Coding Agent

```
@tembo [your task description]
```

**Example:**

```
@tembo Fix the authentication bug in the login flow
```

## Advanced Command Options

Tembo supports flexible command syntax with multiple options. You can use either bracket format or inline format:

### Bracket Format

```
@tembo [option1=value1, option2=value2] [your task description]
```

**Example:**

```
@tembo [branch=dev, repo=owner/webapp, agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet] Add password strength validation
```

### Available Options

- **`branch=`** - Specify the base branch for the PR

  - Example: `branch=main`, `branch=develop`, `branch=feature/auth`

- **`repo=`** - Target a specific repository or multiple repositories

  - Single repository: `repo=owner/repository`, `repo=myorg/webapp`
  - Multiple repositories: `repo=owner/frontend,owner/backend` or `repo=frontend backend` (space-separated)
  - Example: `@tembo [repo=myorg/webapp,myorg/api] Add authentication to both frontend and backend`

- **`agent=`** - Specify which coding agent and model to use (format: `agentType:model`)
  - Example: `agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`, `agent=codex:gpt-5-medium`
  - Supported coding agents: `claudeCode`, `codex`, `opencode`, `amp`, `cursor`
  - If no coding agent is specified, Tembo uses your organization's default configuration
  - See [Coding Agents documentation](/features/coding-agents) for all available options

### Working with Multiple Repositories

For tasks that span multiple repositories (e.g., full-stack features):

1. **Specify multiple repos in the command:**
   ```
   @tembo [repo=owner/frontend,owner/backend] Add user authentication
   ```
   or use space-separated format:
   ```
   @tembo [repo=frontend backend] Add user authentication
   ```

2. **Tembo will create separate pull requests** for each repository and coordinate changes across all selected repositories

3. **Example use cases:**
   - Full-stack features requiring both frontend and backend changes
   - API changes that need updates in multiple service repositories
   - Documentation updates across multiple repos

## Coding Agent Selection

Tembo automatically determines the best coding agent for your task based on your organization's configuration. Here's how the selection works:

**Default Behavior:**
- If you don't specify an agent, Tembo uses your organization's default agent configuration
- You can set organization-wide defaults in the [Settings page](https://app.tembo.io/settings)
- Individual repositories can override these defaults in their settings

**Specifying an Agent:**
```
@tembo [agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet] Your task description here
```

**Examples by Task Type:**

```
// Quick bug fix with Claude Code & Haiku
@tembo [agent=claudeCode:claude-4-5-haiku] Fix the null pointer exception in utils/parser.ts

// Complex refactoring with Cursor & Grok
@tembo [agent=cursor:grok] Refactor the authentication system to use OAuth2

// Frontend work with OpenCode & Opus
@tembo [agent=opencode:claude-4.1-opus] Add responsive design to the dashboard component
```

### Thread Context Utilization

When you mention `@tembo` in a thread, the coding agent automatically:

- Reads the entire conversation history
- Understands the context from previous messages
- Incorporates team discussions into the solution

# Supported Triggers

Tembo reacts to Slack interactions and maps them to automation triggers (use a `slack.*` naming convention in your `triggerName`, e.g., `slack.app_mention`). The Integrations page in the app shows the live set enabled for your org. Supported events:

- `app_mention`
- `slash_command`
- `message_action`
- `thread_reply`

See Automations for how to create triggers from Slack events.
## Status Updates

Tembo keeps you informed throughout the task lifecycle:

**Reaction indicators on your message:**
- ⌛️ **Hourglass** - Tembo is working on the task
- ✅ **Check mark** - Task completed successfully
- ❌ **X mark** - Task failed or encountered an error

**Direct messages for longer tasks:**
- Progress updates as the coding agent works
- Pull request links when code changes are ready
- Error details if the task cannot be completed

**Channel updates when complete:**
- Links to generated pull requests with summary of changes

## Best Practices

**Write clear, specific task descriptions:**

Good examples:
```
@tembo Add error handling to the user registration endpoint
@tembo Optimize the product search query by adding an index on the name column
```

Less effective:
```
@tembo Fix the bug
@tembo Make it faster
```

**Use threads for collaboration:**
1. Team discusses the problem and potential approaches in a thread
2. When ready, mention `@tembo` with the final task description
3. Tembo reads the full thread context and incorporates the discussion

# Troubleshooting

## Tembo Not Responding to Mentions

If Tembo doesn't respond when you mention `@tembo`:

1. **Check bot installation** - Verify Tembo is installed in your workspace on the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations)
2. **Verify channel access** - Ensure the Tembo bot has been invited to the channel (`/invite @tembo`)
3. **Review permissions** - Confirm all required permissions were granted during installation
4. **Check integration status** - The integration may need to be reconnected if permissions were revoked

## Tasks Not Creating Pull Requests

If tasks are acknowledged but no pull requests appear:

1. **Verify repository connection** - Ensure you have connected GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories to Tembo
2. **Check repository mapping** - Confirm your default repository is set correctly in the Slack integration settings
3. **Review task description** - Provide clear, actionable task descriptions that specify what code changes are needed

## Wrong Repository Targeted

If Tembo creates PRs in the wrong repository:

1. **Set default repository** - Configure your preferred repository in the Slack integration settings
2. **Use explicit repo option** - Specify the repository in your command: `@tembo [repo=owner/repo] your task`
3. **Check organization settings** - Verify the default repository setting at the organization level
