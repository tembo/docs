# Usage

## Creating Tasks with @tembo

You can create development tasks by mentioning Tembo in any channel or DM:

```
@tembo fix the login bug in the authentication module
```

When you create a task, Tembo will:
1. React with ⌛ to acknowledge the request
2. Send a "task created successfully" message with a "View on Tembo" button
3. Begin working on the task

## Repository and Branch Selection

Tembo can automatically detect the appropriate repository, or you can specify it explicitly:

```
@tembo fix the login bug agent:senior-engineer repo:frontend branch:develop
```

### Available Parameters:
- `agent:` - Specify which Tembo agent to use (e.g., `senior-engineer`, `junior-developer`)
- `repo:` - Target repository name
- `branch:` - Target branch for the PR

## Working in Direct Messages

Tembo works seamlessly in private DMs, allowing you to:
- Create personal development tasks
- Receive private notifications about task progress
- Review PR summaries before sharing with your team

## Task Completion Flow

When Tembo completes a task:

1. **Status Update**: The ⌛ reaction changes to ✅
2. **Completion Message**: Receive a "task completed" notification in the thread
3. **PR Card**: View a summary of the changes made in the pull request
4. **Creator Tagging**: The original task creator is automatically tagged (can be disabled in settings)
5. **Clean Messages**: The initial "task created" message is automatically deleted
