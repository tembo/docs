Connect Plane issues with Tembo to automatically generate code solutions and pull requests.

# Features

There once was a dev with a plan,  
To fix bugs as fast as they can,  
With Plane and Tembo combined,  
Issues assigned and refined,  
Code solutions appear with a span!  

- Assign issues to Tembo or add the "tembo" label to trigger work
- AI-powered code solutions with pull request generation  
- Seamless integration with your Plane workspace and projects

# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to Plane.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your Plane workspace. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Setup">
    Configure which GitHub repositories Tembo should target for each Plane project. You can set repository mappings in your integration settings.
    
    You can set a default repository to avoid configuring this for every issue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment">
    Now you can assign Plane issues to Tembo to trigger automated code solutions.
  </Step>

# Usage

## Triggering Tembo

There are two ways to trigger Tembo to work on a Plane issue:

1. **Assignment**: Assign the issue directly to Tembo
2. **Labels**: Add a "tembo" label to the issue

## Issue Requirements

For best results, ensure your Plane issues include:

- Clear problem description
- Expected behavior or acceptance criteria
- Relevant technical context or constraints

## Generated Solutions

Once triggered, Tembo will:

1. Analyze the issue requirements
2. Generate appropriate code solutions
3. Create a pull request with the implementation
4. Comment back on the Plane issue with progress updates

The generated pull request will reference the original Plane issue for easy tracking.
