# Working with Pull Requests

## Commenting on PRs

When reviewing Tembo's pull requests, you can request changes or improvements by tagging `@tembo` in your comments. This ensures Tembo responds to your specific feedback while ignoring internal team discussions or comments directed at other team members.

**Example:**
```
@tembo Please update this function to include error handling
```

Without the `@tembo` tag, Tembo will not respond to the comment, allowing for cleaner team communication.

## Failed Workflow Detection

Tembo automatically monitors your GitHub Actions workflows and detects when they fail. When a workflow fails due to broken tests, linting errors, or other issues, Tembo will analyze the failure, identify the root cause, and create a PR with a fix.

This helps maintain a healthy CI/CD pipeline without manual intervention.
