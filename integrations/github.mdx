# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in Tembo and click the `Install` button next to GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Authorize Tembo to access your GitHub account. You can select specific repositories or all repositories. You'll be redirected back to the Integrations page when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Repositories">
    After syncing completes (may take a few minutes), select which repositories you want Tembo to scan under "Active Repositories" on the Integrations page.

    Only repositories you activate here will be scanned for issues and receive improvement PRs.

# Usage

## Automated Scanning

Once you've activated repositories, Tembo automatically scans for:

- **TODO Comments** - Finds and implements requested functionality from TODO items
- **Security Issues** - Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in your code
- **Performance Issues** - Detects slow queries, inefficient algorithms, and optimization opportunities
- **Technical Debt** - Discovers areas that need refactoring or modernization
- **Code Quality** - Spots potential bugs, unused code, and anti-patterns

## Pull Requests

When Tembo finds an issue it can address, it will:

1. **Create a Pull Request** - Opens a PR with the proposed fix or improvement
2. **Add Context** - Includes a detailed description of what was changed and why
3. **Request Review** - Assigns the PR for team review following your repository's workflow

## Working with Tembo PRs

**Reviewing Pull Requests:**
- Review Tembo's PRs just like any other team member's work
- Leave comments directly on the code if you need changes
- Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) feature to have Tembo address your review comments automatically

**Best Practices:**
- Configure repository settings to match your team's preferences
- Use [Rule Files](/features/rule-files) to help Tembo understand your coding standards
- Set up [Hooks](/features/hooks) to customize Tembo's behavior for your workflow
# Working with Pull Requests

## Commenting on PRs

When reviewing Tembo's pull requests, you can request changes or improvements by tagging `@tembo` in your comments. This ensures Tembo responds to your specific feedback while ignoring internal team discussions or comments directed at other team members.

**Example:**
```
@tembo Please update this function to include error handling
```

Without the `@tembo` tag, Tembo will not respond to the comment, allowing for cleaner team communication.

## Failed Workflow Detection

Tembo automatically monitors your GitHub Actions workflows and detects when they fail. When a workflow fails due to broken tests, linting errors, or other issues, Tembo will analyze the failure, identify the root cause, and create a PR with a fix.

This helps maintain a healthy CI/CD pipeline without manual intervention.
