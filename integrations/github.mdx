# Supported Webhooks

Tembo listens to the following GitHub events and maps them to workflow triggers (you can reference them as `github.<event>` in your `triggerName`, e.g., `github.pull_request.opened`):

- `pull_request.opened`
- `pull_request.closed`
- `pull_request.reopened`
- `pull_request.ready_for_review`
- `pull_request.converted_to_draft`
- `pull_request.edited`
- `pull_request_review.submitted`
- `issue_comment.created`
- `installation.created`
- `installation.deleted`
- `installation.new_permissions_accepted`
- `installation_repositories.added`
- `installation_repositories.removed`

See Workflow Automations for how to create triggers that start workflows from these events.
