description: "Reusable automation patterns for common use cases"
---

## Overview

These patterns represent common automation use cases that can be adapted to your specific needs. Use them as templates to build your own automations.

---

## Pattern: Digest Creator

Collect information over a time period and summarize it.

**Examples**:

- Daily changelog
- Weekly issue summary
- Monthly metrics report

**When to Use**:
- You need to aggregate information from multiple sources
- Information should be delivered at regular intervals
- Team needs summaries rather than individual updates

---

## Pattern: Event Responder

React to specific events and take action.

**Examples**:

- PR opened → Request reviewers
- CI failed → Attempt auto-fix
- Issue created → Check for duplicates

**When to Use**:
- You need immediate action when events occur
- Responses are consistent and can be automated
- Manual monitoring is time-consuming

---

## Pattern: Health Monitor

Regularly check the health of systems or processes.

**Examples**:

- Check for stale issues
- Monitor CI success rates
- Track open PR aging

**When to Use**:
- You need proactive alerts about problems
- Status should be checked regularly
- Manual monitoring is tedious or error-prone

---

## Pattern: Content Generator

Create or enhance content automatically.

**Examples**:

- Generate blog frontmatter
- Create release notes
- Write PR descriptions

**When to Use**:
- Content follows a predictable pattern
- Manual content creation is repetitive
- Consistency is important

---

## Pattern: Notifier

Keep team informed about important events.

**Examples**:

- Post release announcements
- Alert on security issues
- Share deployment status

**When to Use**:
- Team needs to stay informed about specific events
- Information should go to multiple channels
- Timing is important (immediate or scheduled)

---

## Combining Patterns

Many powerful automations combine multiple patterns:

**Example: Release Workflow**
1. **Event Responder**: New tag created triggers automation
2. **Digest Creator**: Summarizes commits since last release
3. **Content Generator**: Creates formatted release notes
4. **Notifier**: Posts to Slack and creates GitHub release

**Example: Issue Health Monitor**
1. **Health Monitor**: Checks for stale issues weekly
2. **Digest Creator**: Groups issues by priority and team
3. **Notifier**: Posts summary to team channels

## Tips for Using Patterns

### Start with a Pattern

Choose the pattern that best matches your use case, then customize it. Don't try to build from scratch.

### Mix and Match

Combine patterns to create more sophisticated workflows. Most real-world automations use multiple patterns.

### Keep It Simple

Start with the simplest pattern that solves your problem. Add complexity only when needed.

### Document Your Pattern

When you create a new pattern or variation, document it for your team to reuse.
