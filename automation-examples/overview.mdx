Welcome to Tembo Automation Examples! This guide contains practical automation ideas and best practices to help you get started with building powerful automations on Tembo.

## Getting Started

Tembo automations allow you to build intelligent workflows that run on a schedule or are triggered by events. Each automation has access to:

- **MCP Servers**: Connect to external services (GitHub, Linear, Slack, etc.)
- **AI Models**: Use Claude and other AI models to analyze and generate content
- **Scheduling**: Run automations on a schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Triggers**: React to events from your integrations

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple and Iterate

Begin with straightforward automations that solve clear problems. Don't try to automate everything at once.

**Good first automation**: Daily changelog summary
**Avoid starting with**: Complex multi-step workflows with many conditionals

### 2. Use Clear, Specific Prompts

Your automation prompt should be:

- **Specific**: Define exactly what you want to happen
- **Structured**: Use numbered steps or bullet points
- **Error-aware**: Include instructions for edge cases

**Example - Vague Prompt**:

```text
Check for new issues and do something with them
```

**Example - Clear Prompt**:

```text
1. Find Linear issues created in the last 24 hours with label "bug"
2. For each issue, check if it has reproduction steps
3. If missing reproduction steps, comment: "Please add reproduction steps to help us fix this faster"
4. If it has reproduction steps, add label "triaged"
```

### 3. Test with Dry Runs

Before enabling an automation that posts to Slack or creates issues:

1. Test with a private Slack channel or test repository
2. Review the first few runs manually
3. Adjust the prompt based on actual output
4. Enable for production channels once validated

### 4. Schedule Appropriately

Choose the right frequency for your automation:

- **Hourly**: Event monitoring (new tags, CI failures)
- **Daily**: Summaries and digests (changelog, standup updates)
- **Weekly**: Reports and reminders (stale issues, metrics)
- **Monthly**: Long-term trends and cleanup tasks

<Warning>Avoid over-polling APIs. Most information doesn't need minute-by-minute updates.</Warning>

### 5. Format for Readability

Use Slack Block Kit or Markdown to make automation outputs easy to scan:

**Good**:

```text
✨ New Features
• User authentication - PR #123
• Dark mode support - PR #456

🐛 Bug Fixes
• Fixed login redirect - PR #789
```

**Bad**:

```text
New feature user authentication in PR 123 and dark mode in PR 456. Also fixed bug with login redirect in PR 789.
```

### 6. Include Context and Links

Always provide links back to the source:

- GitHub PR or issue links
- Linear issue links
- Commit SHAs for code changes
- Direct links to logs or dashboards

This helps team members quickly jump to relevant information.

### 7. Handle Errors Gracefully

Your automation should handle common errors:

```text
1. Try to fetch data from API
2. If API returns an error:
   - Log the error
   - Post a brief error message to #automation-errors
   - Do not spam the team channel
3. If no data is found:
   - Skip posting (don't post "no updates")
4. Continue to next step
```

### 8. Respect Rate Limits

Be mindful of API rate limits:

- GitHub: 5,000 requests/hour
- Linear: Rate limits vary by plan
- Slack: Different limits for posting vs reading

**Tips**:

- Batch operations when possible
- Cache data that doesn't change frequently
- Use webhooks instead of polling when available

### 9. Document Your Automations

For each automation, document:

- **Purpose**: What problem does it solve?
- **Schedule/Trigger**: When does it run?
- **Dependencies**: What MCP servers does it need?
- **Output**: Where does it post/what does it create?
- **Owner**: Who maintains it?

This helps your team understand and maintain automations over time.
