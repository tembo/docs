Collaborate with your team in Tembo by inviting members to your organization. Team members can work together on issues, review AI-generated pull requests, and manage integrations.

## Roles and Permissions

### Members

Team members have access to:

- **Assign issues to Tembo** from Linear, Jira, Slack, or directly through the dashboard
- **Review pull requests** created by Tembo across all connected repositories
- **Provide feedback** through the feedback loop to iterate on Tembo's work
- **View organization activity** including completed tasks and active issues
- **Configure repository settings** including rule files and coding agent preferences

### Admins

Administrators have all member permissions plus:

- **Manage billing** and subscription settings
- **Configure integrations** for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Sentry, and other services
- **Invite and remove team members** from the organization
- **Control repository access** and activation settings
- **View usage metrics** and team performance analytics

## Inviting Team Members

To invite team members to your Tembo organization:

1. Navigate to your [Tembo Dashboard](https://app.tembo.io)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
3. Click **Invite Member**
4. Enter the email address of the team member
5. Select their role (Member or Admin)
6. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited member will receive an email with instructions to join your organization.

## Best Practices

**Start with Core Contributors**
Invite developers who frequently review pull requests or manage deployments first. They'll provide the most valuable feedback to improve Tembo's work.

**Use Member Role by Default**
Most team members only need Member access to work with Tembo. Reserve Admin access for team leads who manage billing and integrations.

**Onboard Gradually**
Rather than inviting your entire team at once, start with a small group to establish workflows and best practices before expanding access.

**Set Expectations**
Make sure team members understand that they're responsible for reviewing and approving Tembo's pull requests before merging to production.

## Team Collaboration

Once your team is onboarded, you can:

- **Distribute issue assignments** across team members based on their expertise
- **Review PRs together** using your existing code review process
- **Share feedback patterns** to help Tembo learn your team's preferences
- **Monitor team activity** to understand how Tembo impacts your development velocity
