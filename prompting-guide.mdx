Writing clear, actionable prompts is key to getting great results from Tembo. Following these guidelines will help ensure successful outcomes.

## When to Tag @tembo

**Tag required:**
- **Pull Request comments** - Request changes or provide feedback
- **GitHub Issues** - Start work on features or fixes
- **Slack messages** - Trigger tasks in channels or DMs

**No tag needed:**
- Tembo Dashboard tasks
- Linear/Jira issues assigned to Tembo
- Initial task creation in any context

Tagging ensures Tembo responds to your feedback while ignoring internal team discussions.

## Anatomy of a Great Prompt

A well-structured prompt includes: **clear objective** (what needs to be done), **context** (why it matters), **acceptance criteria** (when it's complete), and **technical details** (requirements/constraints).

## Examples

### Bug Fix

```text
Title: Fix memory leak in background job processor

Description:
The background job processor in workers/job-processor.ts accumulates memory
and crashes after ~6 hours. Heap grows from 512MB to 4GB before crash.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Memory stable over 24+ hours
- No queued jobs lost
- Add memory monitoring

Technical Details:
See Sentry #12345. Issue likely in cleanup logic around line 156.
```

**Why it works:** Specific file location, reproduction context, measurable criteria, linked error tracking, and technical hypothesis.

### Feature Implementation

```text
Title: Add email validation to user registration form

Requirements:
- RFC 5322 compliant format checking
- Block disposable email domains
- Real-time UI validation with specific error messages
- Client and server-side validation
- Unit tests for edge cases

Technical Notes:
Frontend: components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx
Backend: services/user-service.ts
Use zod for validation. Blocklist: github.com/disposable/disposable-email-domains
```

**Why it works:** Clear requirements, file locations, existing patterns referenced, external dependencies identified.

---

### Refactoring

```text
Title: Refactor authentication middleware to async/await

Description:
Modernize middleware/auth.js from callback-based patterns to async/await.

Scope:
- Convert callbacks to async/await
- Add try/catch error handling
- Add TypeScript types
- Maintain backward compatibility

Acceptance Criteria:
- All tests pass without modification
- No breaking changes to API consumers

Context: Part of Node.js modernization (TEM-1234).
```

**Why it works:** Clear scope, backward compatibility requirements, links to related work.

---

### API Endpoint

```text
Title: Add pagination to GET /api/users endpoint

Requirements:
- Cursor-based pagination (not offset-based)
- Default 50 users, max 200 per request
- Backward compatible for existing clients

Response Format:
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "abc123",
    "has_more": true,
    "total_count": 1500
  }
}

Technical Details:
Endpoint: routes/api/users.ts
Use utils/pagination.ts. Add index on users.created_at.
Update openapi.yml.
```

**Why it works:** Specific approach, example response format, backward compatibility addressed.

## Less Effective Prompts

| Type | Example | Problem |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Too Vague** | "Fix the bug" / "The app is broken" | No specific issue, context, or verification criteria |
| **Missing Context** | "Improve performance" / "Make it faster" | No metrics, target, or scope defined |
| **Overly Broad** | "Update the app and add new features" | Multiple unrelated tasks—break into smaller issues |

---

## Tips by Issue Type

| Type | Include |
|------|---------|
| **Bug** | Steps to reproduce, expected vs actual, error messages, environment, error tracking links |
| **Feature** | User story, mockups, success metrics, edge cases, dependencies |
| **Refactor** | Current problems, desired state, constraints, specific files, related tech debt |
| **Docs** | What/why, audience, existing docs to reference, examples, format preferences |

## Working with Jira and Linear

**Labels:** Use type labels (`bug`, `feature`, `refactor`), priority labels, and scope labels (`frontend`, `backend`).

**Link Related Issues:** Set parent/child relationships, mark blocking dependencies, connect issues in same epic.

**Attachments:** Screenshots, recordings, error logs, design files, external documentation.

**Metadata:** Priority, story points, component/team, sprint/milestone, due dates.

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Repository Tasks

```text
Title: Add user authentication to frontend and backend

Frontend (webapp repo):
- Login/signup forms with JWT storage
- Auth context provider
- Protected route wrapper

Backend (api repo):
- /auth/login and /auth/signup endpoints
- JWT generation and validation middleware
- Refresh token rotation

Note: Requires changes to both repositories. Ensure implementations are compatible.
```

### Database Migrations

```text
Title: Add indexes to improve orders table performance

Indexes:
- (user_id, created_at) for order history
- (status, updated_at) for admin filtering
- (store_id, created_at) for store dashboards

Acceptance Criteria:
- Migration with up/down scripts
- Test in staging first
- Measure with EXPLAIN (target: <500ms)
- Document in MIGRATIONS.md

Context: Dashboard queries taking 3-5s on 2M+ rows.
```

## Getting the Best Results

Be specific with file paths, line numbers, and function names. Explain the why, not just the what. Define measurable success criteria. Include example inputs/outputs. Link to relevant resources. Break large tasks into focused issues. Iterate based on results.

## Questions?

Start with three questions: What needs to change? Why? How will we know it's done? Then add technical details and context as needed.
