## Quick Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple">
    Begin with one automation that solves a clear problem. Validate it works before adding complexity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be specific in prompts">
    Vague prompts lead to unpredictable results. Use numbered steps, specify formats, and include edge cases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test first">
    Use a test repository or private Slack channel when setting up new automations. Switch to production once validated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include links">
    Always provide links back to PRs, issues, commits, or dashboards so team members can take action quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle empty results">
    Tell your automation what to do when there's nothing to report—usually skip posting rather than posting "no updates."
