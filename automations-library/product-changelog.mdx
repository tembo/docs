## Overview

Product changelog automations help keep your team and customers informed about changes without manual effort. These automations can summarize commits, generate release notes, and distribute updates across multiple channels.

---

## Example 1: Daily Product Changelog Summary

**Use Case**: Keep your team informed about daily code changes without manual work.

**How it works**:
- Runs once per day at 9 AM
- Summarizes all commits merged to main branch in the last 24 hours
- Formats changes into "Customer facing changes" and "Internal changes"
- Posts to #product-changelog Slack channel

**Schedule**: Daily at 9:00 AM

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Summarize all changes merged to the main branch in the last 24 hours.

Group the changes into two sections:
1. Customer facing changes - features, bug fixes, and improvements users will notice
2. Internal changes - refactoring, infrastructure, and developer experience improvements

Use Slack Block Kit to format the message with:
- A header with today's date
- Sections for each category
- Bullet points for each change
- Link to relevant pull requests

Post the summary to the #product-changelog channel.
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: GitHub, Slack

**Tips**:
- Use emoji indicators (✨ for features, 🐛 for bugs, 🔧 for internal changes)
- Include PR links for transparency
- Skip posting if there are no changes

---

## Example 2: Release Notes Generator

**Use Case**: Automatically generate release notes when a new tag is created.

**How it works**:
- Monitors for new git tags in your repository
- Compares changes since the previous release tag
- Generates comprehensive release notes using AI
- Posts to multiple channels (Slack, GitHub releases)

**Schedule**: Hourly (checks for new tags)

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Check if a new tag has been created in the repository since the last processed tag.

If a new tag exists:
1. Get all commits between the previous tag and the new tag
2. Analyze the commits and generate release notes with:
   - New features
   - Bug fixes
   - Breaking changes
   - Deprecations
   - Performance improvements

3. Format the release notes in markdown
4. Create a GitHub release with the notes
5. Post a summary to #releases Slack channel
6. Update the automation state with the latest processed tag

If no new tag exists, do nothing.
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: GitHub, Slack

**Advanced Features**:
- Automation state management to track the last processed tag
- Automatic categorization of changes based on commit messages
- Integration with Linear to link resolved issues

## Tips for Product Changelog Automations

### Be User-Focused

When generating changelogs, focus on the impact to end users rather than technical implementation details. Your customers care about what changed for them, not internal refactoring.

### Use Consistent Formatting

Stick to a consistent format for changelogs across all releases. This makes it easier for users to scan and understand changes quickly.

### Include Version Numbers

Always include version numbers or tags in release notes to help users track which version they're running.

### Link to Documentation

For significant new features, include links to relevant documentation or guides to help users understand how to use the new functionality.
