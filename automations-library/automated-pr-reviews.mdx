## Overview

Code reviews are essential but time-consuming. This automation uses AI agents like Claude to automatically review every pull request, catching issues before human reviewers even look at the code.

**What it does:**
- Triggers automatically when a PR is opened or updated
- Reviews code changes against your team's guidelines
- Leaves specific, actionable comments on problematic lines
- Improves PR descriptions for clarity
- Auto-approves clean PRs (optional)

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click **Templates Library**
3. Install the **"PR Review"** template
4. Configure your review guidelines
5. Enable for your repositories

---

## How It Works

When a pull request is opened or updated:

1. **Fetches the diff** — Gets all changed files and modifications
2. **Analyzes the code** — AI reviews against your guidelines
3. **Leaves comments** — Adds inline comments on specific lines with issues
4. **Updates description** — Optionally improves the PR description
5. **Approves or requests changes** — Based on findings

<Tip>The AI catches subtle issues like mismatched timeout values, incorrect slice ranges, and logic errors that are easy to miss in manual review.</Tip>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

**Trigger**: Pull request opened / synchronized

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Review this pull request for code quality and potential issues.

## Review Guidelines
1. Check for bugs and logic errors
2. Verify error handling is adequate
3. Look for security vulnerabilities
4. Ensure code follows our style guide
5. Check for performance issues

## Review Process
1. Fetch the PR diff
2. Analyze each changed file
3. For each issue found:
   - Leave an inline comment on the specific line
   - Explain what's wrong and why
   - Suggest a fix

4. If the PR description is unclear:
   - Update it with a clearer summary

5. Final decision:
   - If no issues: Approve the PR
   - If minor issues: Comment but don't block
   - If major issues: Request changes

## What NOT to review
- Don't nitpick style if it matches our guidelines
- Don't suggest refactors unless there's a clear bug
- Don't comment on unchanged code
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: GitHub

## Customization Options

### Team-Specific Reviewers

Create different review profiles for different teams:

**Frontend Team**:
```text
Additional review criteria for frontend code:
- Check for accessibility issues (missing alt text, ARIA labels)
- Verify responsive design considerations
- Look for React anti-patterns (missing keys, unnecessary re-renders)
- Ensure proper loading and error states
- Check bundle size impact for new dependencies
```

**Backend Team**:
```text
Additional review criteria for backend code:
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Verify proper authentication/authorization
- Look for N+1 query problems
- Ensure database transactions are used correctly
- Check for proper logging and monitoring
```

**Security-Focused**:
```text
Security review checklist:
- Input validation on all user data
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Parameterized queries for database access
- Secrets not hardcoded in code
- Proper CORS configuration
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
```

### Per-Developer Configuration

Adjust review strictness based on experience:

```text
For PRs from junior developers:
- Be more thorough with explanations
- Suggest learning resources for common issues
- Always leave at least one positive comment

For PRs from senior developers:
- Focus only on bugs and security issues
- Skip style suggestions
- Trust architectural decisions unless clearly wrong
```

### Repository-Specific Rules

Different rules for different repos:

```text
For the "payments" repository:
- Extra scrutiny on any financial calculations
- Require explicit error handling for all API calls
- Flag any changes to transaction logic for human review

For the "internal-tools" repository:
- Lighter review, focus on major bugs only
- Auto-approve formatting-only changes
```

---

## Example Review Comment

> **Line 47:** The timeout value here is 5000ms, but the API call on line 23 uses 3000ms. This will cause the retry logic to fail before the request times out.
>
> **Suggestion:** Use a consistent timeout value, or make the retry timeout longer than the request timeout.

The AI catches issues including bugs, security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS), logic errors, and performance concerns (N+1 queries).

---

## Auto-Approval Settings

Configure when PRs can be automatically approved:

```text
Auto-approve PRs that meet ALL of these criteria:
- No bugs or security issues found
- Changes are under 100 lines
- No changes to critical paths (auth, payments, data migrations)
- All tests pass
- Author has >10 merged PRs in this repo

For auto-approved PRs, still leave a comment:
"✅ Automated review complete. No issues found. Auto-approved."
```

## Tips for Better Reviews

- **Provide codebase context** — Include your stack, frameworks, and common patterns in the prompt
- **Reference your style guide** — Add team conventions (function length, nesting limits, documentation requirements)
- **Define severity levels** — Specify which issues should block (security, bugs) vs. comment-only (style, refactoring)
- **Review the reviewer** — Periodically check if comments are actionable and adjust your prompt accordingly
