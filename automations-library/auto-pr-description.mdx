## Overview

Writing good PR descriptions is important for code review, but it's often tedious and time-consuming. This automation uses Claude to analyze your code changes and generate clear, well-formatted PR descriptions automatically.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes the diff of your pull request
- Generates a concise summary of the changes
- Follows your team's PR template and guidelines
- Runs automatically when a PR is opened

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click **Templates Library**
3. Install the **"Generate PR Description"** template
4. Configure for your repository

That's it! The automation will now generate descriptions for new PRs.

---

## How It Works

When a pull request is opened, the automation:

1. **Fetches the diff** — Gets all changed files and their modifications
2. **Analyzes the changes** — Claude examines the code to understand what changed and why
3. **Generates the description** — Creates a formatted summary following your guidelines
4. **Updates the PR** — Adds the generated description to the pull request

<Tip>The automation uses Claude Haiku for fast, cost-effective generation. Even 200+ lines of changes get condensed into a clear, scannable summary.</Tip>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

**Trigger**: Pull request opened

**Prompt Template**:

```text
A new pull request has been opened: #{pr_number}

1. Fetch the diff for this PR
2. Analyze the changes:
   - What files were modified?
   - What is the purpose of these changes?
   - Are there any breaking changes?

3. Generate a PR description following this format:
   ## Summary
   [1-2 sentence overview of the changes]

   ## Changes
   - [Bulleted list of key changes]

   ## Testing
   - [How to test these changes]

4. Update the PR description with the generated content
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: GitHub

## Customization Options

### Team-Specific Templates

Different teams often have different PR standards. You can customize the automation for specific contexts:

**Frontend Team**:
```text
Include in the description:
- Components added/modified
- Visual changes (screenshots if applicable)
- Browser compatibility notes
- Accessibility considerations
```

**Backend Team**:
```text
Include in the description:
- API changes (endpoints, parameters)
- Database migrations
- Performance implications
- Backward compatibility notes
```

### Repository Filters

Configure the automation to run only on specific repositories:
- Run on `frontend-*` repos with frontend template
- Run on `api-*` repos with backend template
- Skip documentation-only repos

### Author Filters

Trigger based on PR author:
- Different templates for junior vs senior developers
- Skip for bot-created PRs
- Custom templates for external contributors

## Example Output

> **Summary**: Implements OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers.
>
> **Changes**: Added AuthProvider component, OAuth callback handlers, token refresh logic, protected route wrapper.
>
> **Testing**: Run `npm test` for unit tests, `npm run dev:auth` for local OAuth testing.

## Tips for Better Results

- **Provide context** — Include your tech stack (e.g., "Next.js with TypeScript") in the prompt for more relevant descriptions
- **Include your PR template** — Paste your team's existing format so the automation follows the same structure
- **Specify exclusions** — Tell it to skip obvious details like line-by-line explanations
- **Handle edge cases** — Add instructions for doc-only PRs, dependency updates, or other special scenarios
