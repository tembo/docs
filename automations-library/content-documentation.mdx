## Overview

Content and documentation automations help maintain high-quality content with less manual effort. These automations can generate metadata, check for consistency, and enhance SEO.

## Example: Blog Post Frontmatter Generator

**Use Case**: Automatically generate SEO-friendly metadata for blog posts.

**How it works**:
- Triggered when a PR adds or modifies markdown files in the blog directory
- Reads the blog post content
- Generates title suggestions, descriptions, and tags
- Updates the frontmatter in the file
- Comments on the PR with the suggestions

**Trigger**: PR opened with changes to `blog/**/*.md`

**Prompt Template**:

```text
A blog post has been added or modified in {file_path}.

1. Read the blog post content
2. Generate SEO-optimized metadata:
   - Title suggestions (3 options, max 60 characters)
   - Meta description (max 160 characters)
   - 5-7 relevant tags/keywords
   - Suggested social media preview text

3. Check if frontmatter exists:
   - If missing: Add complete frontmatter with generated content
   - If exists: Suggest improvements in a PR comment

4. Create a commit with the frontmatter changes
5. Comment on the PR with:
   - The generated metadata
   - SEO score and suggestions
   - Alternative title options for the author to consider
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: GitHub

**Content Guidelines**:
- Keep titles under 60 characters for SEO
- Descriptions should be compelling and include keywords
- Use markdown formatting in descriptions sparingly
- Include publication date and author metadata
