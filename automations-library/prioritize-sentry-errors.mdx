## Overview

Teams using Sentry often face a common challenge: too many errors, not enough time. Real-time Slack notifications flood your channels, making it hard to know which bugs to tackle first.

This automation solves that by analyzing your Sentry projects daily and delivering a prioritized list of the most impactful bugs—sorted by customer impact.

**What it does:**
- Runs on a schedule (e.g., every morning at 8 AM)
- Analyzes errors across your Sentry projects
- Ranks bugs by number of affected users
- Posts the top issues to Slack with direct Sentry links
- Optionally creates Linear tickets for immediate action

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Create a new automation
3. Set the schedule (e.g., daily at 8:00 AM)
4. Enable **Sentry** and **Slack** MCP servers
5. Use the prompt template below

---

## How It Works

Each morning (or at your chosen time), the automation:

1. **Connects to Sentry** — Fetches recent errors from your projects
2. **Analyzes impact** — Ranks issues by number of affected users
3. **Prioritizes** — Selects the top N most impactful bugs
4. **Reports** — Posts a formatted summary to Slack with direct links
5. **Creates tickets** — Optionally opens Linear issues for each bug

<Tip>Focus on customer impact, not just error frequency. An error affecting 1,000 users once is often more important than one hitting 10 users 100 times.</Tip>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

**Trigger**: Schedule (daily)

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Analyze Sentry errors and identify the highest-priority bugs to fix today.

1. Connect to Sentry and fetch errors from the last 24 hours
2. For each error, gather:
   - Error message and type
   - Number of affected users
   - Number of occurrences
   - First and last seen timestamps
   - Affected project/service

3. Rank errors by customer impact (users affected × severity)

4. Select the top 3 most impactful bugs

5. Post to #engineering-bugs in Slack with this format:
   🚨 **Daily Bug Priority Report**

   **#1: [Error Title]**
   - Users affected: X
   - Occurrences: Y
   - Project: [name]
   - [Link to Sentry]

   **#2: [Error Title]**
   ...

6. For each bug, create a Linear issue with:
   - Title: [Error type]: [Brief description]
   - Description: Full error details and Sentry link
   - Label: "bug", "from-sentry"
   - Priority: Based on ranking (1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium)
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: Sentry, Slack, Linear (optional)

## Customization Options

### Adjust Priority Criteria

Customize how bugs are ranked:

```text
Rank errors using this formula:
- Critical: Errors in payment or auth flows (weight: 3x)
- High: Errors affecting >100 users (weight: 2x)
- Medium: Errors occurring >50 times (weight: 1.5x)
- Low: Everything else (weight: 1x)

Score = users_affected × occurrence_count × weight
```

### Filter by Project

Focus on specific services:

```text
Only analyze errors from these Sentry projects:
- production-api
- production-web
- mobile-app

Ignore errors from:
- staging-*
- internal-tools
```

### Customize Report Frequency

**Hourly monitoring** (for critical systems):
```text
Check for new critical errors every hour.
Only report if there are errors affecting >50 users.
```

**Weekly summary** (for lower-priority projects):
```text
Generate a weekly summary every Monday at 9 AM.
Include trends: Are errors increasing or decreasing?
```

### Different Channels for Different Severity

```text
Route reports based on severity:
- Critical bugs (>500 users): Post to #incidents and page on-call
- High bugs (>100 users): Post to #engineering-bugs
- Medium bugs: Add to weekly digest only
```

## Example Output

The Slack message includes a header with date, ranked errors with metrics, and a summary:

> **#1: TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined**
> Users affected: 847 | Occurrences: 2,341 | Project: production-api | 🔗 View in Sentry
>
> **#2-3:** Additional errors ranked by user impact...
>
> 📊 Total: 47 unique issues affecting 2,891 users

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Start with One Project

Don't try to monitor everything at once. Start with your most critical service and expand from there.

### 2. Tune the Threshold

If you're getting too many reports, increase the user threshold:
```text
Only include errors affecting more than 50 users.
```

### 3. Exclude Known Issues

Filter out errors you're already working on:
```text
Ignore errors with these Sentry issue IDs: [list]
Ignore errors containing "deprecation warning"
```

### 4. Add Business Context

Make reports more actionable by including business impact:
```text
For errors in the checkout flow, estimate revenue impact:
- Average order value: $50
- Conversion rate impact: ~2% of affected users abandon
- Daily revenue at risk: users_affected × $50 × 0.02
```

### 5. Track Trends Over Time

Add week-over-week comparison:
```text
Compare to last week:
- Are the same errors still in top 3?
- Has user impact increased or decreased?
- Note any new errors that appeared this week
```
