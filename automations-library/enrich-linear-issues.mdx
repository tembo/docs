## Overview

When someone creates a Linear ticket, they rarely include all the context needed to implement it. Months later, when a developer picks up the issue, they're left searching through Slack threads, documentation, and code to understand what's needed.

This automation solves that by automatically enriching new Linear issues with relevant context from your connected tools—codebase, Slack conversations, Sentry errors, and Notion docs.

**What it does:**
- Triggers when a new Linear issue is created
- Searches your codebase for relevant files and patterns
- Finds related Slack conversations
- Pulls in Sentry errors if applicable
- References relevant Notion documentation
- Adds a detailed comment with implementation guidance

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click **Templates Library**
3. Install the **"Enrich Linear Issues"** template
4. Connect your integrations (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Sentry)
5. Enable for your Linear workspace

---

## How It Works

When a new Linear issue is created:

1. **Parses the issue** — Extracts key terms and intent from the title and description
2. **Searches the codebase** — Finds relevant files, functions, and patterns
3. **Checks Slack** — Looks for related conversations and context
4. **Queries Sentry** — Finds related errors if it's a bug report
5. **Searches Notion** — Pulls in relevant documentation
6. **Adds enriched comment** — Posts implementation guidance to the issue

<Tip>Developers picking up old tickets no longer need to ask "where is this code?" or "what was the original conversation about?"—it's all in the issue.</Tip>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

**Trigger**: Linear issue created

**Prompt Template**:

```text
A new Linear issue has been created. Enrich it with relevant context.

## Issue Details
- Title: {issue_title}
- Description: {issue_description}
- Labels: {issue_labels}
- Creator: {issue_creator}

## Gather Context

### 1. Codebase Search
Search GitHub for:
- Files related to the feature/bug area
- Similar implementations or patterns
- Recent changes to related code
- Relevant tests

### 2. Slack Search
Find related conversations:
- Threads mentioning this feature
- Bug reports from users
- Design discussions
- Previous decisions about this area

### 3. Sentry Search (if bug-related)
Look for:
- Related error messages
- Stack traces
- Affected user count
- When the error first appeared

### 4. Notion Search
Find relevant docs:
- Technical specifications
- Design documents
- API documentation
- Previous PRs or RFCs

## Create Enrichment Comment

Post a comment on the Linear issue with this structure:

### 📁 Relevant Code
- List key files with brief descriptions
- Note any recent changes
- Highlight relevant functions/components

### 💬 Slack Context
- Summarize relevant conversations
- Link to important threads
- Note any decisions made

### 🐛 Related Errors (if applicable)
- Link to Sentry issues
- Summarize error patterns
- Note affected users

### 📚 Documentation
- Link to relevant Notion pages
- Summarize key specs
- Note any constraints or requirements

### 💡 Implementation Hints
- Suggest where to start
- Note potential gotchas
- Reference similar past work
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Sentry (optional)

## Example Enriched Issue

Here's what an enriched Linear issue looks like:

**Original Issue:**
> **Title:** Add "out of credit" banner to dashboard
>
> **Description:** When users run out of credits, show a banner prompting them to upgrade.

**Automated Enrichment Comment:**

```markdown
## 🤖 Context gathered by Tembo

### 📁 Relevant Code

**Banner Components**
- `src/components/Banner/Banner.tsx` - Base banner component
- `src/components/Banner/UpgradeBanner.tsx` - Similar upgrade prompt banner

**Credit Logic**
- `src/hooks/useCredits.ts` - Hook for fetching credit balance
- `src/api/billing.ts` - Billing API endpoints (see `getCredits()`)

**Recent Changes**
- PR #234 (2 weeks ago) added the `useCredits` hook
- PR #201 refactored banner styling

### 💬 Slack Context

**Original Discussion** ([#product, Nov 15](slack://link))
> Sarah: "Users are confused when they hit the credit limit.
> Can we add a clear banner?"
>
> Mike: "Yes, should link directly to the upgrade page.
> Use the warning variant, not error."

**Design Decision** ([#design, Nov 16](slack://link))
> The banner should be dismissible but reappear on page refresh
> until credits are added.

### 📚 Documentation

- [Billing System Overview](notion://link) - How credits work
- [Banner Component Spec](notion://link) - Design guidelines
- [Upgrade Flow](notion://link) - Where the banner should link

### 💡 Implementation Hints

1. Use the existing `UpgradeBanner` as a template
2. Call `useCredits()` to check balance
3. Show banner when `credits <= 0`
4. Link to `/settings/billing` for upgrade
5. Add dismiss logic with localStorage (key: `credit-banner-dismissed`)

## Customization Options

### Filter by Issue Type

Only enrich certain types of issues:

```text
Only enrich issues that:
- Have label "needs-context" or "new-feature"
- Are in the "Backlog" or "Todo" state
- Don't already have comments

Skip issues that:
- Are marked as "quick-fix"
- Already have implementation details
- Are documentation-only tasks
```

### Depth of Search

Adjust how thoroughly to search:

**Quick Enrichment:**
```text
Quick context gathering (for simple issues):
- Search codebase for directly mentioned files only
- Check last 7 days of Slack
- Skip Sentry and Notion
```

**Deep Enrichment:**
```text
Thorough context gathering (for complex features):
- Search entire codebase for related patterns
- Check last 90 days of Slack across all channels
- Include Sentry errors from last 30 days
- Search all Notion workspaces
```

### Team-Specific Context

Different context for different teams:

**Frontend Issues:**
```text
For issues labeled "frontend":
- Focus on component files and styling
- Check #frontend and #design Slack channels
- Include Figma links from Notion
- Note browser compatibility requirements
```

**Backend Issues:**
```text
For issues labeled "backend":
- Focus on API routes and database models
- Check #backend and #infrastructure channels
- Include Sentry errors and performance data
- Note API versioning considerations
```

### Auto-Assignment Hints

Suggest who should work on it:

```text
Based on the code areas involved, suggest assignees:
- Check git blame for recent contributors to relevant files
- Note who participated in Slack discussions
- Suggest team members with expertise in this area
```

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Use Consistent Naming

The automation works best when your codebase has clear naming:
- Feature names match across code, Slack, and Linear
- Files and folders have descriptive names
- Slack channels are topic-specific

### 2. Connect All Your Tools

The more integrations you enable, the richer the context:
- **GitHub**: Code context and recent changes
- **Slack**: Conversations and decisions
- **Notion**: Specs and documentation
- **Sentry**: Error context for bugs

### 3. Write Better Initial Issues

Even with enrichment, better input = better output:
```text
Include in your issue:
- What the feature/fix should do
- Why it's needed (user problem)
- Any known constraints
```

### 4. Review and Refine

Check the enrichment quality periodically:
- Is it finding relevant code?
- Are Slack threads helpful?
- Adjust search terms in the prompt if needed
