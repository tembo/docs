The quality of your automation depends on the quality of your prompt. Here's how to write prompts that get reliable results.

## Be Specific

Vague prompts lead to unpredictable results. Define exactly what you want.

**Vague:**
```text
Check for new issues and do something with them
```

**Specific:**
```text
1. Find Linear issues created in the last 24 hours with label "bug"
2. For each issue, check if it has reproduction steps
3. If missing reproduction steps, comment: "Please add reproduction steps to help us fix this faster"
4. If it has reproduction steps, add label "triaged"
```

## Use Numbered Steps

Structure your prompt as a numbered sequence. This helps the AI follow a clear path and makes debugging easier.

```text
1. Fetch all PRs merged to main in the last 24 hours
2. Group PRs by type (feature, bugfix, chore)
3. For each group, format as a bulleted list with PR titles and links
4. Post to #changelog with today's date as the header
5. If no PRs were merged, skip posting
```

## Include Edge Cases

Tell the automation what to do when things go wrong or when there's nothing to do.

```text
1. Try to fetch data from API
2. If API returns an error:
   - Log the error
   - Post a brief error message to #automation-errors
   - Do not spam the team channel
3. If no data is found:
   - Skip posting (don't post "no updates")
4. Continue to next step
```

## Conditional Logic

Use clear if/then language to handle different scenarios.

```text
If the PR has changes to the database schema:
  - Request review from @database-team
  - Run database migration checks
  - Add label "needs-migration-review"
Otherwise:
  - Follow standard review process
```

**Common conditions:**
- File path patterns (`if changes include /api/*`)
- PR size thresholds (`if more than 500 lines changed`)
- Time-based (`if during business hours`)
- Priority levels (`if priority is urgent`)

## Format Output for Readability

Specify how output should be formatted. Slack messages are easier to scan when well-structured.

**Good format:**
```text
Use Slack Block Kit to format with:
- A header with today's date
- Sections for each category
- Bullet points for each item
- Links to relevant PRs

Example output:
✨ New Features
• User authentication - PR #123
• Dark mode support - PR #456

🐛 Bug Fixes
• Fixed login redirect - PR #789
```

**Bad format:**
```text
New feature user authentication in PR 123 and dark mode in PR 456. Also fixed bug with login redirect in PR 789.
```

## Include Context and Links

Always provide links back to the source so team members can take action.

```text
For each item, include:
- GitHub PR or issue link
- Linear issue link if connected
- Commit SHA for code changes
- Direct link to logs or dashboards
```

## Use Variables for Configuration

Make prompts flexible by calling out configurable values.

```text
Configuration:
- STALE_THRESHOLD: 14 days
- TARGET_CHANNEL: #standup
- PRIORITY_THRESHOLD: high

Find issues older than {STALE_THRESHOLD} that are {PRIORITY_THRESHOLD} priority...
Post results to {TARGET_CHANNEL}...
```

This makes it easy to adjust behavior without rewriting the whole prompt.

## Document Your Intent

Add a brief comment at the top explaining what the automation does. This helps when revisiting the automation later.

```text
# Purpose: Weekly stale issue reminder
# Posts to: #standup every Monday
# Threshold: Issues not updated in 14+ days

1. Find all open Linear issues that haven't been updated in 14 days...
```
