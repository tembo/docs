## Overview

Team communication automations help reduce communication overhead by automatically keeping everyone informed about important events, stale issues, and team updates.

---

## Example: Stale Issue Reminder

**Use Case**: Keep your team on top of issues that haven't been updated in a while.

**How it works**:
- Runs weekly on Monday mornings
- Finds issues that haven't been updated in 14+ days
- Categorizes by priority and team
- Posts a digest to Slack with actionable items

**Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 9:00 AM

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Find all open Linear issues that:
- Haven't been updated in the last 14 days
- Are not in "Backlog" status
- Have an assignee

Group the issues by:
1. High/Urgent priority (needs immediate attention)
2. Medium priority
3. Low priority

For each group, format a Slack message with:
- Issue title and identifier
- Assignee
- Days since last update
- Quick link to the issue

Post to #standup channel with:
- A summary count of stale issues
- Top 5 most urgent items that need attention
- Mention assignees for urgent items

If there are no stale issues, post a celebration message! 🎉
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: Linear, Slack

**Customization Options**:
- Adjust the staleness threshold (7, 14, 30 days)
- Filter by specific teams or projects
- Exclude certain issue types or labels
- Add team-specific channels for different categories

## Tips for Team Communication Automations

- **Find the right frequency** - Weekly reminders work well, but adjust based on your workflow; avoid noise
- **Make it actionable** - Include clear next steps and links; enable action, not just information
- **Celebrate wins** - Positive reinforcement when there are no stale issues helps maintain good habits
- **Avoid notification fatigue** - Be selective about what and where you post; focus on important updates
- **Provide context** - Include enough information so team members understand without clicking through multiple links
