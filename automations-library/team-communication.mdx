## Overview

Team communication automations help reduce communication overhead by automatically keeping everyone informed about important events, stale issues, and team updates.

---

## Example: Stale Issue Reminder

**Use Case**: Keep your team on top of issues that haven't been updated in a while.

**How it works**:
- Runs weekly on Monday mornings
- Finds issues that haven't been updated in 14+ days
- Categorizes by priority and team
- Posts a digest to Slack with actionable items

**Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 9:00 AM

**Prompt Template**:

```text
Find all open Linear issues that:
- Haven't been updated in the last 14 days
- Are not in "Backlog" status
- Have an assignee

Group the issues by:
1. High/Urgent priority (needs immediate attention)
2. Medium priority
3. Low priority

For each group, format a Slack message with:
- Issue title and identifier
- Assignee
- Days since last update
- Quick link to the issue

Post to #standup channel with:
- A summary count of stale issues
- Top 5 most urgent items that need attention
- Mention assignees for urgent items

If there are no stale issues, post a celebration message! 🎉
```

**MCP Servers Needed**: Linear, Slack

**Customization Options**:
- Adjust the staleness threshold (7, 14, 30 days)
- Filter by specific teams or projects
- Exclude certain issue types or labels
- Add team-specific channels for different categories

## Tips for Team Communication Automations

### Find the Right Frequency

Weekly reminders work well for most teams, but adjust based on your team's workflow. Too frequent and it becomes noise, too infrequent and issues get forgotten.

### Make it Actionable

Every notification should include clear next steps and links to take action. Don't just inform—enable action.

### Celebrate Wins

When there are no stale issues or all builds are passing, celebrate it! Positive reinforcement helps maintain good habits.

### Avoid Notification Fatigue

Be selective about what gets posted and where. Not every event needs a notification. Focus on truly important updates.

### Provide Context

Include enough information in notifications so team members can understand the situation without needing to click through multiple links.
