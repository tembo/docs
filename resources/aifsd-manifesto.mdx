The adoption of AI coding assistants has dramatically increased development velocity. This shift has forced organizations to rethink code review and merge processes.

**The challenge now lies in efficiently moving code from PR to production**.

---

## 1. Let AI write the first attempt

- think a little, and get the ball rolling
- be specific about what you want — vague prompts get vague code
- don't overthink it — ready, fire, aim

## 2. When chat gets tedious, take the wheel

- if you're copy-pasting code blocks for the fifth time, stop
- pull the branch, commit directly

## 3. You own the merge, period

- AI is your intern, not your boss
- you're responsible for what ships — act like it

## 4. Tag team like pros

- AI writes scaffolding, you handle the gnarly bits
- AI refactors, you write integration tests
- back and forth

## 5. Speed > perfection (on iteration zero)

- get something working first
- it's easier to reason about a solution with concrete code
- AI excels at "make it work", you excel at "make it right"

## 6. Leverage async workflows

- automate bug reports, and error + other alerts to generate PRs
- if the AI has to wait for you to initiate, or your laptop must stay open for work to continue, you're a bottleneck

## 7. Commit early, commit often — both of you

- small commits from AI, small commits from you
- git history should tell a story, not be a novel

## 8. Testing is still your job, not optional

- it's easier than ever to have test suites—AI can draft tests well
- but you need to decide what actually needs testing, and why
- with this principle alone, your software quality can go way up… without costing you much, if any, time

## 9. Review everything like it came from a junior dev

- because it did
- AI writes confident code that might be confidently wrong

## 10. The human always has the last word

- when in doubt, your judgment wins
- AI suggests, you decide

## 11. Domain knowledge is your unfair advantage

- AI knows syntax and patterns, but you know why the business logic exists and what could go wrong in production
- that context gap is where human judgment becomes irreplaceable
