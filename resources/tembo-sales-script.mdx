# Tembo Sales Script

**Last Updated:** December 8, 2025

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Tembo is your unified interface for background coding agents. Think of it as autopilot for your engineering tasks — fixing production bugs, implementing features from issues, reducing technical debt, and keeping documentation up-to-date. Any coding agent. Any model. Full context from your entire stack.

## The Problem We Solve

Engineering teams are drowning in repetitive work:

- **Production bugs** pile up in error tracking tools like Sentry
- **Technical debt** accumulates as teams focus on features
- **Documentation** falls behind the codebase
- **Code reviews** and PR iterations create bottlenecks
- **Project management tools** (Linear, Jira) fill up with small tasks that never get prioritized
- **CI/CD failures** require manual investigation and fixes

The result? Engineers spend 30-40% of their time on toil instead of building what matters.

## What is Tembo?

Tembo is a **background coding agent platform** that autonomously handles engineering tasks across your entire development workflow.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Automated Bug Fixes**
   - Monitors Sentry, AWS CloudWatch, and other error tracking tools
   - Automatically generates PRs to fix production errors
   - Reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) from hours to minutes

2. **Issue Implementation**
   - Assign issues from Slack, Linear, Jira, or GitHub
   - Tembo writes code to solve bugs, build features, or refactor
   - Works across multiple repositories simultaneously

3. **Technical Debt Reduction**
   - Periodic codebase analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Identifies refactoring opportunities and performance issues
   - Submits PRs for quick wins automatically

4. **Documentation Automation**
   - Syncs monorepo changes to docs repositories
   - Keeps feature documentation current
   - Generates changelogs from commit history

5. **CI/CD Monitoring**
   - Detects failed workflows and broken tests
   - Investigates root causes and pushes fixes
   - Reduces "red pipeline" incidents

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have GitHub Copilot"
Copilot is excellent for code suggestions, but Tembo handles **complete tasks autonomously**. Copilot requires a developer to drive; Tembo works in the background. They complement each other — Copilot for writing code, Tembo for maintaining and fixing it.

### "Our code is too complex for AI"
That's exactly why Tembo supports multiple coding agents and models. Start with simpler tasks (bug fixes, docs updates) and gradually expand. Our sandbox environment ensures safe execution, and you review all PRs before merge.

### "Security concerns about AI accessing our codebase"
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Self-hosted deployment available for enterprise
- Granular access controls per repository
- Audit logs for all actions
- Signed commits for full transparency

### "What if Tembo makes a mistake?"
- All changes come as PRs, you review before merge
- Sandbox environment prevents production impact
- Failed tasks are logged with full context
- @tembo feedback loop allows quick iterations
- Integration with existing code review tools

### "How is this different from AutoGPT or LangChain agents?"
Tembo is purpose-built for engineering workflows, not general AI automation:
- Pre-built integrations with dev tools
- Git operations are reliable and production-tested
- Multi-repository coordination
- Team collaboration features (task assignment, notifications)
- Enterprise security and compliance

## Discovery Questions

1. **Current pain points**
   - "What percentage of your sprint goes to bug fixes vs new features?"
   - "How long does it take to fix a production bug from detection to deploy?"
   - "How much technical debt is in your backlog?"

2. **Tool stack**
   - "What project management tool do you use?" (Linear/Jira)
   - "How do you track production errors?" (Sentry/DataDog)
   - "What's your source control setup?" (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

3. **Team size & structure**
   - "How many engineers on your team?"
   - "Do you have dedicated DevOps/SRE?"
   - "How do you prioritize maintenance vs features?"

4. **Readiness signals**
   - "Have you used AI coding assistants before?"
   - "Do you have CI/CD and automated testing?"
   - "Are your repositories well-documented?"

## Call to Action

## Closing Tips

1. **Lead with pain**: Focus on the problem (toil, bugs, tech debt) before the solution
2. **Demo real value**: Show Tembo fixing an actual bug from their Sentry/GitHub
3. **Start small**: Suggest beginning with one integration (Sentry or GitHub)
4. **Emphasize control**: They review all PRs, nothing merges without approval
5. **Highlight ROI**: 8-12 hours saved per engineer per week = significant cost savings

**Remember**: Tembo is not replacing engineers — it's augmenting them by handling repetitive work so they can focus on building what matters.
