Install Tembo as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for quick access from your home screen with an app-like experience. PWAs combine the best of web and native apps, giving you instant access without app store downloads.

## Installation

1. Open [app.tembo.io](https://app.tembo.io) in your browser
2. Access the share or install menu (look for an install icon in the address bar or use the browser menu)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" and confirm the installation

Once installed, Tembo appears on your home screen or app launcher just like a native application.

## Benefits

- **Quick access:** Launch directly from your home screen or dock
- **Full-screen mode:** Distraction-free experience without browser UI
- **Offline resilience:** Core functionality remains available with spotty connectivity
- **Push notifications:** Stay updated with important alerts (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

**Install option not visible?**
- **Chrome Desktop:** Look for the install icon in the address bar (computer with down arrow)
- **Safari iOS:** Tap the Share button at the bottom, then scroll to "Add to Home Screen"
- **Chrome Android:** Tap the three-dot menu and select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install app"
- **Edge:** Tap the three-dot menu, go to "Apps," then select "Install Tembo"

**Supported browsers:** Chrome and Edge on all platforms, Safari on iOS 14.3 and later, Firefox with limited support.

**PWA not updating?** Remove or uninstall the app from your device, clear your browser cache if needed, then reinstall from your browser.
