## Install Tembo as a Progressive Web App (PWA)

You can install Tembo as a Progressive Web App on your device for quick access and an app-like experience. This allows you to use Tembo directly from your home screen without opening a browser.

### Installation Steps

2. **Access the share menu** - Look for the share icon in your browser (usually located in the address bar or browser menu).

3. **Select "Add to Home Screen"** - From the share menu, tap or click on "Add to Home Screen" option.

4. **Confirm installation** - Follow the prompts to add Tembo to your home screen.

### Benefits of PWA Installation

- **Quick access** - Launch Tembo directly from your home screen
- **App-like experience** - Works like a native app with full-screen mode
- **Offline resilience** - Continue viewing recent data even with intermittent connectivity
- **Push notifications** - Receive important updates directly to your device (coming soon)

Once installed, you can launch Tembo like any other app on your device and enjoy seamless access to your engineering agent.
