Tembo works on a pay-as-you-go credit system with **no monthly commitments or hidden fees**.

We currently sell credit packs of different sizes to meet your needs.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed when Tembo analyzes your code and generates pull requests:

- **One credit = one task attempt** - Each time Tembo attempts to solve an issue, it consumes one credit
- **Complex issues may require more credits** - If Tembo needs multiple attempts to solve an issue, each attempt uses one credit
- **Simple fixes use fewer credits** - Straightforward tasks typically complete in one attempt
- **Credits never expire** - Purchase credits at your own pace without worrying about expiration
- **Unused credits roll over** - Any credits you don't use remain in your account indefinitely

## What Consumes Credits

Credits are used for:

- Creating pull requests from assigned issues (Linear, Jira, Slack)
- Fixing production errors detected from Sentry
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Implementing TODO comments
- Processing feedback on pull requests through the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)
- Scanning repositories for technical debt and improvements

## Credit Refunds

In certain situations, you may receive automatic credit refunds:

- **Failed tasks** - If Tembo is unable to complete a task due to an internal error, the credit is refunded
- **Duplicate issues** - If the same issue is queued multiple times, duplicate attempts may be refunded
- **Invalid inputs** - Tasks that fail due to configuration issues or missing access may be refunded

## Usage and Monitoring

You can monitor your credit consumption in real-time through the [Billing dashboard](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) in your Tembo app.

## Purchasing Credits

To start getting pull requests, purchase Tembo Compute Credits through the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) within the Tembo app. You can buy additional credits at any time as needed.

## Auto-Reload (Coming Soon)

We are developing a feature to automatically reload your Tembo Compute Credits when they are running low, up to a maximum monthly limit. Until this feature is available, you can manually reload your credits at any time.

## Enterprise Options

- Volume discounts
