Tembo works on a pay-as-you-go credit system with **no monthly commitments or hidden fees**.

We currently sell credit packs of different sizes to meet your needs.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed when Tembo analyzes your code and generates pull requests:

- Each credit typically produces one pull request
- Complex issues may require more credits
- Simple fixes use fewer credits
- Credits never expire, so you can purchase them at your own pace

## Usage and Monitoring

You can monitor your credit consumption in real-time through the [Billing dashboard](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) in your Tembo app.

## Purchasing Credits

To start getting pull requests, purchase Tembo Compute Credits through the [Billing page](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) within the Tembo app. You can buy additional credits at any time as needed.

## Auto-Reload (Coming Soon)

We are developing a feature to automatically reload your Tembo Compute Credits when they are running low, up to a maximum monthly limit. Until this feature is available, you can manually reload your credits at any time.

## Enterprise Options

For larger teams, we offer:

- Volume discounts
- Custom integrations
- Dedicated support
