Tembo supports coding agents to solve your software engineering tasks. Each coding agent has different capabilities, models, and configuration options.

## Available Coding Agents

<CodingAgentsTable />

### Claude Code (Default)

Claude Code is Tembo's default coding agent, powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-opus-4-5` - Maximum capability with Opus 4.5
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Codex

Codex is a coding agent powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-5 models with varying reasoning levels, allowing you to choose the right balance of speed and thoroughness.

**Supported Models:**

- `gpt-5-medium` (Default) - Balanced reasoning
- `gpt-5-minimal` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `gpt-5-low` - Quick reasoning
- `gpt-5-high` - Deep reasoning for complex problems
- `gpt-5-codex` - Specialized for code generation tasks

### Opencode

Opencode is an alternative coding agent supporting Anthropic Claude models, providing flexibility in model selection.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-opus-4-5` - Maximum capability with Opus 4.5
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Amp

Amp is a powerful coding agent powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

Amp manages its own model selection automatically and defaults to `claude-opus-4-5` (Opus 4.5) for maximum capability.

### Cursor

Cursor is a coding agent supporting Anthropic Claude models, OpenAI GPT models, Google's Gemini, Cursor's Composer, and XAI's Grok through the Cursor CLI.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-opus-4-5` - Maximum capability with Opus 4.5
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `gpt-5.1` - Latest GPT-5.1 model
- `gpt-5.1-codex` - GPT-5.1 specialized for code
- `gpt-5.1-codex-high` - GPT-5.1 Codex with high reasoning
- `gemini-3-pro` - Google's Gemini 3 Pro model
- `composer-1` - Cursor's Composer model
- `grok` - XAI's Grok model for advanced reasoning

## Choosing the Right Coding Agent

Different coding agents excel at different types of tasks. Here's guidance on when to use each:

**For most tasks:** Start with **Claude Code** (default). It provides the best balance of code quality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for general software engineering work.

**For complex refactoring or architectural changes:** Use **Claude Code with `claude-opus-4-5`** or **Codex with `gpt-5-high`** for deeper reasoning capabilities.

**For quick fixes and simple updates:** Use **Claude Code with `claude-4-5-haiku`** or **Codex with `gpt-5-minimal`** for faster execution on straightforward tasks.

**For team consistency:** If your team already uses a specific IDE or coding environment (Cursor, Amp, etc.), select the matching coding agent for familiar code patterns and style.

## Selecting a Coding Agent

Coding Agents are specified using a coding agent key format: `agentType:model`

**Examples:**

- `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `claudeCode:claude-opus-4-5`
- `codex:gpt-5-medium`
- `opencode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `amp:claude-opus-4-5`
- `cursor:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `cursor:gpt-5.1-codex`
- `cursor:grok`

If no coding agent is specified, Tembo defaults to `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`.

## Choosing the Right Model

Different models offer different tradeoffs between speed, cost, and capability:

**For most tasks:** Use the default models (`claude-4-5-sonnet` or `gpt-5-medium`)
- Balanced performance for typical engineering tasks
- Good reasoning capability with reasonable speed
- Cost-effective for production use

**For simple, straightforward tasks:** Use lightweight models (`claude-4-5-haiku` or `gpt-5-minimal`)
- Faster execution for simple bug fixes
- Lower cost for high-volume operations
- Best for well-defined, smaller scope work

**For complex architectural work:** Use advanced models (`claude-opus-4-5` or `gpt-5-high`)
- Deep reasoning for system design decisions
- Better handling of large, multi-file refactors
- More thorough analysis of edge cases

## Using Rule Files

All coding agents use rule files (`tembo.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.) to understand your project's coding standards and conventions. See [Rule Files](/features/rule-files) for the complete list of supported files and configuration details.

## Switching Between Coding Agents

You can configure which coding agent to use for your organization or specific tasks through:

1. **Dashboard Settings** - Set a default coding agent for all tasks
2. **API Configuration** - Specify a coding agent key when creating tasks via API
3. **Integration Settings** - Configure per-integration coding agent preferences

Contact your Tembo administrator or check the [API documentation](/api-reference) for details on coding agent configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Task Taking Too Long

If a task is taking longer than expected:

1. **Check task complexity** - Complex tasks with large codebases naturally take longer. Consider breaking them into smaller, focused tasks
2. **Review model selection** - Opus models provide deeper reasoning but take longer. Try Sonnet or Haiku for simpler tasks
3. **Check for infinite loops** - Review the task logs in your dashboard for signs of repeated operations

### Unexpected Code Output

If the generated code doesn't match your expectations:

1. **Verify rule files** - Ensure your `tembo.md` or other [rule files](/features/rule-files) clearly define your coding standards
2. **Add more context** - Include specific file paths, function names, and patterns in your task description
3. **Use the Feedback Loop** - Provide specific feedback via PR comments to refine the output

### Model Not Available

If you receive an error that a model is unavailable:

1. **Check the model name** - Verify the model ID matches the supported models listed above
2. **Try default model** - Omit the model specification to use the default (`claude-4-5-sonnet`)
3. **Contact support** - Some models may have availability restrictions. Reach out to [support@tembo.io](mailto:support@tembo.io) for assistance
