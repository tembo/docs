Tembo supports agents to solve your software engineering tasks. Each agent has different capabilities, models, and configuration options.

## Available Agents

| Agent           | Model Providers         | Default Model       |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic               | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Codex**       | OpenAI                  | `gpt-5-medium`      |
| **Opencode**    | Anthropic/OpenAI        | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Amp**         | Anthropic               | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Cursor**      | Anthropic/OpenAI/Cursor | `gpt-5-medium`      |

### Claude Code (Default)

Claude Code is Tembo's default agent, powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Codex

Codex is an agent powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-5 models with varying reasoning levels, allowing you to choose the right balance of speed and thoroughness.

**Supported Models:**

- `gpt-5-medium` (Default) - Balanced reasoning
- `gpt-5-minimal` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `gpt-5-low` - Quick reasoning
- `gpt-5-high` - Deep reasoning for complex problems

### Opencode

Opencode is an alternative agent supporting both Anthropic Claude models and OpenAI GPT models, providing flexibility in model selection.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Amp

Amp is a powerful AI coding agent powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

Amp uses smart model detection and currently uses [Sonnet 4.5](https://ampcode.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) as its main model.

### Cursor

Cursor is an AI coding agent supporting both Anthropic Claude models and OpenAI GPT models through the Cursor CLI.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `gpt-5` - Powerful reasoning and code generation
- `composer-1` - OpenAI's composer model

## Choosing the Right Agent

Different agents excel at different types of tasks. Here's guidance on when to use each:

**For most tasks:** Start with **Claude Code** (default). It provides the best balance of code quality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for general software engineering work.

**For complex refactoring or architectural changes:** Use **Claude Code with `claude-4.1-opus`** or **Codex with `gpt-5-high`** for deeper reasoning capabilities.

**For quick fixes and simple updates:** Use **Claude Code with `claude-4-5-haiku`** or **Codex with `gpt-5-minimal`** for faster execution on straightforward tasks.

**For team consistency:** If your team already uses a specific IDE or coding environment (Cursor, Amp, etc.), select the matching agent for familiar code patterns and style.

## Selecting an Agent

Agents are specified using an agent key format: `agentType:model`

**Examples:**

- `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `codex:gpt-5-medium`
- `opencode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `amp:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `cursor:gpt-5`

If no agent is specified, Tembo defaults to `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`.

## Choosing the Right Model

Different models offer different tradeoffs between speed, cost, and capability:

**For most tasks:** Use the default models (`claude-4-5-sonnet` or `gpt-5-medium`)
- Balanced performance for typical engineering tasks
- Good reasoning capability with reasonable speed
- Cost-effective for production use

**For simple, straightforward tasks:** Use lightweight models (`claude-4-5-haiku` or `gpt-5-minimal`)
- Faster execution for simple bug fixes
- Lower cost for high-volume operations
- Best for well-defined, smaller scope work

**For complex architectural work:** Use advanced models (`claude-4.1-opus` or `gpt-5-high`)
- Deep reasoning for system design decisions
- Better handling of large, multi-file refactors
- More thorough analysis of edge cases

## Using Rule Files

Rule files allow you to provide agent-specific instructions and coding standards. Each agent reads from its designated configuration file in your repository root (see **Rule File** listed above for each agent).

These files can include:

- Coding standards and style guidelines
- Project-specific conventions
- Commands to run before or after certain operations
- Context about your architecture and patterns

Learn more about [rule files](/features/rule-files).

## Switching Between Agents

You can configure which agent to use for your organization or specific tasks through:

1. **Dashboard Settings** - Set a default agent for all tasks
2. **API Configuration** - Specify an agent key when creating tasks via API
3. **Integration Settings** - Configure per-integration agent preferences

Contact your Tembo administrator or check the [API documentation](/api-reference) for details on agent configuration.
