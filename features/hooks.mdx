Tembo Hooks allow you to customize and extend Tembo's behavior by running custom commands at certain points during execution of a task. This powerful feature enables you to integrate your existing development practices, CI/CD processes, and quality checks directly into Tembo's automated workflow.

## Overview

Tembo Hooks are configured through a `.tembo.json` file in your repository root. These hooks execute shell commands at predefined lifecycle events, giving you full control over how Tembo interacts with your codebase and development environment.

## Configuration

Create a `.tembo.json` file in your repository root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postClone": [
      "npm install",
      "echo 'Repository cloned and dependencies installed'"
    ],
    "prePush": [
      "npm run lint",
      "npm run test",
      "npm run build"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Available Hooks

### `postClone`

Executes immediately after Tembo clones your repository and before it begins working on the issue.

**Common use cases:**
- Install dependencies (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Set up development environment
- Download required assets or configurations
- Initialize database connections or test data

**Example:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postClone": [
      "npm ci",
      "cp .env.example .env.local",
      "npm run db:migrate"
    ]
  }
}
```

### `prePush`

Runs after Tembo has made changes to your code but before pushing the changes and creating a pull request.

**Common use cases:**
- Run linting and formatting (`eslint`, `prettier`, `black`)
- Execute test suites
- Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
- Run security scans or code quality checks
- Generate documentation or update version files

**Example:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "prePush": [
      "npm run lint:fix",
      "npm run test:unit",
      "npm run build",
      "npm run security:scan"
    ]
  }
}
```


## Hook Execution Details

### Execution Environment

- Hooks run in the same Docker sandbox environment as Tembo
- Commands execute in the repository's root directory
- All environment variables available to Tembo are also available to hooks
- Commands run with the same permissions as the Tembo process

### Error Handling

- If any command in a hook fails (returns non-zero exit code), the hook execution stops
- For `postClone` and `prePush` hooks, failures will cause the entire issue resolution process to fail

### Command Execution

- Commands are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array
- Each command runs in a separate shell session
- Commands support shell features like piping, redirects, and environment variables
- Multi-line commands can be written as single strings with semicolons or `&&` operators

## Advanced Configuration Examples

### Full Stack Application

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postClone": [
      "npm install",
      "pip install -r requirements.txt",
      "docker-compose up -d postgres redis",
      "npm run db:migrate",
      "npm run seed:test-data"
    ],
    "prePush": [
      "npm run lint",
      "npm run test:unit",
      "python -m pytest tests/",
      "npm run build",
      "docker-compose run --rm app npm run test:integration"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Monorepo with Multiple Services

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postClone": [
      "npm install --frozen-lockfile",
      "npx lerna bootstrap",
      "npm run build:shared"
    ],
    "prePush": [
      "npx lerna run lint",
      "npx lerna run test --since origin/main",
      "npx lerna run build --since origin/main",
      "npm run test:integration"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Go Application with Custom Tooling

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postClone": [
      "go mod download",
      "go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest",
      "make setup"
    ],
    "prePush": [
      "go fmt ./...",
      "golangci-lint run",
      "go test ./...",
      "go build -o bin/app ./cmd/app",
      "make security-scan"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Commands Fast
- Avoid long-running processes in hooks as they extend the overall solution time
- Use caching mechanisms where possible (`npm ci` instead of `npm install`)
- Consider running only essential checks in `prePush` hooks

### Error Handling
- Include commands that verify successful execution where critical
- Use `set -e` in shell scripts to fail fast on errors
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging

### Security Considerations
- Don't include sensitive information directly in hook commands
- Use environment variables for credentials and API keys
- Be cautious with commands that modify system-level configurations

### Testing Hooks
- Test your hooks locally before committing the `.tembo.json` file
- Start with simple commands and gradually add complexity
- Monitor Tembo's execution logs to verify hooks run as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Hook Commands Not Found**
- Ensure required tools are installed in the `postClone` hook
- Verify the command exists in the Docker environment Tembo uses

**Permission Errors**
- Check that commands don't require elevated privileges
- Ensure file permissions allow the operations you're trying to perform

**Timeout Issues**
- Long-running commands may cause timeouts
- Consider moving lengthy processes to background tasks or separate CI/CD pipelines

### Debugging

- Check Tembo's execution logs in your dashboard for hook output
- Add `echo` statements to track hook progress
- Test commands individually in a similar environment before adding to hooks
