Tembo is the unified interface for background coding agents that connects to your existing tools, listens for signals, and opens pull requests that fix bugs, build features, and improve your codebase.

It's fast, reliable, and built to support the way modern engineering teams actually work.

## The Problem We're Solving

Your best developers may be supercharged by AI, but most are in "wait and see" mode. The AI coding revolution is well underway, but many teams are falling behind because:

- Most developers are stuck in IDE-mode or running single agentic sessions locally
- The evolution has been: AI Chat IDE → Agentic CLIs → ?
- Top performers are running many agentic coding sessions in parallel, but this requires complicated local dev environment setups

## Built to Amplify Teams, Not Replace Them

Tembo brings the power of coding CLIs and IDEs to everyone — not just engineers.

Whether it's sales, support, or product, anyone can spin up work, assign issues, and trigger fixes directly from the tools they already use.

You can refine, iterate, and improve on Tembo's pull requests using natural language feedback, directly inside your pull requests.

## AI That Works at the Task Level, Not the Keystroke

Tembo is different from traditional AI coding tools:

### Just Tag @tembo to Trigger Tasks Anywhere

Tembo integrates with your tickets, listens for signals through your existing CI, and triggers production tools and team processes through your existing workflows.

- No context switching
- No IDE clutter
- Just agentic tools generating real output

### Immediate Background Execution

Tembo operates at the task level with immediate background execution:

- No waiting around while AI thinks
- Agentic tools working in isolated sandboxes
- Real, production-ready pull requests as output

### Put Coding Tasks on Repeat

You can create automated workflows that run on a schedule or react to external signals, scaling your development capacity to handle routine tasks.

## What Tembo Does

Tembo executes engineering work across four key areas:

### Execute Engineering Tickets

- Assign issues from Linear, Jira, etc. to Tembo (or watch for specific tags)
- Takes a first crack at writing code to solve the issue
- Creates production-ready PRs for your review

### Fix Bugs in Production

- Watches your error tracking tools (like Sentry) continuously
- Identifies errors that can be fixed with simple code commits
- Automatically creates fixes and submits PRs

### Improve Database Performance

- Monitors your database query performance
- Suggests changes to code or indexing to speed up your applications
- Implements optimizations automatically

### General Codebase Improvements

- Weekly analysis of each repo to identify technical debt and security vulnerabilities
- Finds opportunities for refactoring and performance improvements
- Submits PRs for low-hanging fruit improvements

## Specific Issue Types Tembo Handles

### Database Performance Issues

- **Slow Queries** - Identifies queries with high execution times (>100ms by default) and optimizes them
- **Missing Indexes** - Detects tables that would benefit from indexing and creates appropriate indexes
- **Unused Indexes** - Finds indexes that aren't being used and removes them to improve write performance

### Application Errors

- **Sentry Errors** - Automatically pulls application errors from Sentry and fixes the underlying code issues
- **Stack Traces** - Analyzes error patterns and implements proper error handling

### Code Quality Issues

- **[TODO Comments](/features/todo-comments)** - Finds TODO items in your codebase and implements the requested functionality
- **Code Bugs** - Uses AI to scan code files and detect potential bugs or performance issues
- **Linear Issues** - Syncs with Linear project management to implement features and fixes

### Extensive Tool Integrations

Tembo connects to your existing development ecosystem across multiple categories:

#### Source Control
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

#### Databases
- PostgreSQL, Supabase

#### Issue Tracking
- Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues

#### Monitoring
- Sentry, Datadog

#### Productivity
- Slack, Raycast

### Multiple Coding Agents and LLMs

Tembo provides a unified interface that works with multiple coding agents and language models:

#### Coding Agents
- Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Ampcode, Copilot CLI

#### Coding LLMs
- Claude, OpenAI GPT, Grok Code, Deepseek, Gemini, Codestral, Qwen

This flexibility lets you choose the right tool for each task while maintaining a consistent workflow.

## It's Go Time

Tembo helps your team move faster and ship more:

### Get More PRs

Tembo connects your tools and team to cutting-edge coding agents, reducing friction to code generation.

### Merge More PRs

With AI generating a first pass, your best developers can now focus on getting the right code merged instead of writing every line themselves.

### 10x Your Team's Agentic Coding Adoption

Amplify your development capacity by delegating more tasks to AI, freeing your team to focus on high-impact work.

## Proven Results

Nearly 4,000 organizations have already started using Tembo, from early-stage startups to established companies like Product Forge, Whop, SMB, Topstep, Kernel, Tenstory, Launch Scout, Seven Hills Technology, Frayt, and The Prompting Company.

> "I've been working with Tembo's asynchronous remote coding agent for about a month now and have found it to be highly effective."
>
> — Stefan Fox, Co-founder, CTO at Mightybot

> "The Tembo agent follows prompt instructions well, with clear step-by-step visualization as it works. The GitHub integration is excellent - it's engaging to interact with the agent by @ mentioning it, and it reliably follows up on tasks."
>
> — Chris Nelson, Co-founder and Principal Engineer at LaunchScout

> "Give any existing issue to @tembo right from your favourite ticketing software!"
