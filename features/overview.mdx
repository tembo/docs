Tembo is a background coding agent that integrates with your existing development tools to automatically create pull requests that fix bugs, implement features, and improve your codebase.

## What Tembo Does

Tembo operates as an engineering agent that works asynchronously in [isolated sandbox environments](/features/sandbox-environment). It monitors your systems, processes assigned tasks, and submits pull requests for your team to review.

### Core Capabilities

**Issue Implementation**
Tembo processes tickets from your project management tools and generates code to address them. You can assign issues from [Linear](/integrations/linear), [Jira](/integrations/jira), or directly through the Tembo dashboard. See [Pull Requests](/features/pull-requests) for details on how tasks are triggered and processed.

**Error Detection and Resolution**
Through [Sentry integration](/integrations/sentry), Tembo monitors application errors and creates fixes for identified issues. It analyzes stack traces and implements appropriate error handling.

**Database Performance Optimization**
When connected to [PostgreSQL](/integrations/postgres), [Supabase](/integrations/supabase), or [AWS RDS](/integrations/aws), Tembo identifies slow queries (>100ms by default), creates missing indexes, and removes unused indexes to improve performance.

**Technical Debt Reduction**
Tembo performs periodic codebase analysis to identify refactoring opportunities, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues. It also processes [TODO comments](/features/todo-comments) found in your code.

## How It Works

Tembo functions through a cycle of detection, execution, and review:

1. **Detection** - Issues are identified through integrations (Sentry errors, database metrics) or manually assigned (Linear/Jira tickets, direct task creation)
2. **Execution** - Tembo analyzes the codebase using your configured [agent](/features/agents) and generates a solution in an isolated environment
3. **Pull Request** - Changes are submitted as a pull request with context about the problem and solution
4. **Feedback Loop** - You can provide feedback by mentioning @tembo in PR comments, and it will iterate on the changes

See [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) for how to refine Tembo's work through natural language feedback in your pull requests.

## Supported Integrations

Tembo connects to your existing development infrastructure:

**Source Control**
- [GitHub](/integrations/github), [GitLab](/integrations/gitlab), [Bitbucket](/integrations/bitbucket)

**Project Management**
- [Linear](/integrations/linear), [Jira](/integrations/jira), GitHub Issues

**Monitoring and Observability**
- [Sentry](/integrations/sentry)

**Databases**
- [PostgreSQL](/integrations/postgres), [Supabase](/integrations/supabase), [AWS RDS](/integrations/aws)

**Communication**
- [Slack](/integrations/slack), [Raycast](/integrations/raycast)

## Available Agents

Tembo provides access to multiple [coding agents](/features/agents) and models:

- **Claude Code** (default) - Powered by Anthropic's Claude models
- **Codex** - Uses OpenAI's GPT-5 models
- **Opencode** - Supports both Anthropic and OpenAI models
- **Amp** - Anthropic-powered agent with smart model detection
- **Cursor** - Supports Anthropic and OpenAI models via Cursor CLI

Each agent supports multiple model tiers for different complexity levels and performance requirements.

## Configuration

**Rule Files**
You can provide agent-specific instructions through [rule files](/features/rule-files) in your repository. These define coding standards, project conventions, and architectural patterns for Tembo to follow.

**Hooks**
[Hooks](/features/hooks) allow you to execute custom logic before and after Tembo's actions, enabling integration with your existing CI/CD pipelines and workflows.

**MCP Servers**
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](/features/mcp-servers) extend Tembo's capabilities by providing additional tools and context sources that agents can access during task execution.

## Team Workflow

Your team maintains control over what code gets merged:

1. Review pull requests created by Tembo using your standard review process
2. Provide feedback through PR comments (mention @tembo to trigger updates)
3. Approve and merge changes when satisfied with the implementation
4. Configure which issues and signals Tembo responds to through integration settings

Tembo generates solutions autonomously, but your team decides what gets deployed.
