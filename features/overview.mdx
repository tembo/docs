Tembo is a proactive AI software engineer that accelerates your team's productivity to the max.

Tembo is built on:

- A powerful language model tuned for software maintenance and code generation
- Real-time signal ingestion from tools like Sentry and Linear (see [integrations](/integrations))
- A PR generation and PR review processing engine
- Custom [workflows and automations](/features/workflows) for scheduled and event-driven tasks

It's your tireless AI engineer who works around the clock to keep your codebase healthy and your team productive.

## How the Agent Works

Tembo turns noisy alerts and performance signals into real code fixes:

1. **Ingests Signals**\
   Pulls from error trackers and database metrics (e.g. Sentry, Postgres)

2. **Triages Autonomously**\
   Detects root causes, prioritizes issues, and builds a fix plan without waiting for a ticket

3. **Writes Pull Requests**\
   Generates clean, merge-ready PRs that align with your repo's best practices

4. **Seeks Approval**\
   You stay in control â€” approve, reject, or modify the fix before it merges

## What Tembo Does

Tembo executes engineering work across five key areas:

### Execute Engineering Tickets

- Assign issues from Linear, Jira, etc. to Tembo (or watch for specific tags)
- Takes a first crack at writing code to solve the issue
- Creates production-ready PRs for your review

### Fix Bugs in Production

- Watches your error tracking tools (like Sentry) continuously
- Identifies errors that can be fixed with simple code commits
- Automatically creates fixes and submits PRs

### Improve Database Performance

- Monitors your database query performance
- Suggests changes to code or indexing to speed up your applications
- Implements optimizations automatically

### General Codebase Improvements

- Weekly analysis of each repo to identify technical debt and security vulnerabilities
- Finds opportunities for refactoring and performance improvements
- Submits PRs for low-hanging fruit improvements

### Run Custom Workflows

- Create [automated workflows](/features/workflows) that run on schedules or triggers
- Handle routine maintenance, documentation updates, or custom analysis
- Build your own AI-powered automation for any repetitive engineering task

## Specific Issue Types Tembo Handles

### Database Performance Issues

- **Slow Queries** - Identifies queries with high execution times (>100ms by default) and optimizes them
- **Missing Indexes** - Detects tables that would benefit from indexing and creates appropriate indexes
- **Unused Indexes** - Finds indexes that aren't being used and removes them to improve write performance

### Application Errors

- **Sentry Errors** - Automatically pulls application errors from Sentry and fixes the underlying code issues
- **Stack Traces** - Analyzes error patterns and implements proper error handling

### Code Quality Issues

- **[TODO Comments](/features/todo-comments)** - Finds TODO items in your codebase and implements the requested functionality
- **Code Bugs** - Uses AI to scan code files and detect potential bugs or performance issues
- **Linear Issues** - Syncs with Linear project management to implement features and fixes

### Integration Support

Tembo connects to your existing tools:

- PostgreSQL databases (including AWS RDS and Supabase)
- GitHub repositories for pull request creation
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Linear for project management

> Tembo focuses on production issues that impact performance and reliability, automatically creating pull requests with the fixes your team needs.

## Tembo Adapts to Your Workflow

Tembo learns and adapts as it works:

- **Context-aware learning** from your codebase, stack, and issue history
- **Cross-team intelligence** from similar fixes applied across the platform
- **Human-in-the-loop feedback** to improve future PR quality
- **Regular updates** from the latest database, observability, and performance research

## What Your Engineers Do

Your team stays in control while Tembo handles the heavy lifting:

- **Review PRs** - Approve, improve, and merge PRs from anywhere (no text editor needed)
- **Focus on features** - Spend time building new functionality instead of maintenance
- **Set priorities** - Guide Tembo's work through ticket assignments and workflow configuration
- **Create workflows** - Build custom automations for your team's unique needs

## Interacting With Tembo

Use Tembo on your terms:

- **Slack:** Get alerts and fixes where your team already lives
- **GitHub:** Review PRs as if they came from a wildly intelligent teammate
- **Web Dashboard:** See what's been fixed, what's coming next, and approve changes
- **Automations:** Set up [workflows](/features/workflows) to handle recurring tasks automatically

### Solution Review and Approval

While Tembo can work autonomously, you maintain control through your workflow toggle:

1. The agent detects an issue and generates a solution
2. You receive a notification with details and recommendations
3. You can approve, reject, or modify the proposed solution
4. Upon approval, the agent implements the changes
