Tembo is the automation layer that connects your engineering tools to your codebase — orchestrating signals into work.

Tembo is built on:

- A powerful language model with full codebase context for high-quality code generation
- Cloud-based orchestration that runs 24/7, connecting to your tools via integrations (see [integrations](/integrations))
- An intelligent PR generation and review processing engine that learns from feedback

**Just tag Tembo** in Slack, Linear, Jira, or let it monitor your systems. It bridges where work appears and where it gets done, helping you get more output from your existing team.

## How Tembo Works: Signals → Work

Tembo orchestrates automation from where work appears to where it gets done:

1. **Connects to Your Tools**\
   Integrates with Slack, Linear, Jira, Sentry, monitoring systems, and more

2. **Receives Signals**\
   Watches for alerts, ticket assignments, Slack mentions, monitoring events, or scheduled tasks

3. **Executes with Context**\
   Uses full codebase knowledge and tool integrations to understand and fix issues

4. **Creates Pull Requests**\
   Generates production-ready PRs with fixes, features, or improvements

5. **Stays in the Loop**\
   Responds to feedback, iterates on changes, and learns from your team's reviews

## What Tembo Automates

Tembo handles repetitive engineering work at the task layer:

### Automation from Signals

- **Always-on monitoring**: Watches Sentry, monitoring systems, and databases 24/7
- **Automatic triage**: Detects issues that can be fixed with code changes
- **Zero-touch PRs**: Creates and submits fixes without requiring ticket creation

### Just Tag Tembo

- **Work from anywhere**: Tag Tembo in Slack, assign in Linear/Jira, or mention in GitHub
- **Stay in your tools**: No need to switch context or learn new interfaces
- **Natural delegation**: Assign work the same way you would to a teammate

### Repetitive Task Automation

- **Bug fixes**: Production errors, failed tests, breaking changes
- **Dependency updates**: Version bumps, security patches, migrations
- **Performance improvements**: Slow queries, missing indexes, optimization opportunities
- **Code maintenance**: TODOs, refactoring, technical debt reduction

### Always Running, Full Context

- **Cloud-based**: Runs in the background 24/7, no local installation needed
- **Complete codebase access**: Understands your entire repo for high-quality fixes
- **Integration-aware**: Connects data from all your tools for informed decisions

## Specific Issue Types Tembo Handles

### Database Performance Issues

- **Slow Queries** - Identifies queries with high execution times (>100ms by default) and optimizes them
- **Missing Indexes** - Detects tables that would benefit from indexing and creates appropriate indexes
- **Unused Indexes** - Finds indexes that aren't being used and removes them to improve write performance

### Application Errors

- **Sentry Errors** - Automatically pulls application errors from Sentry and fixes the underlying code issues
- **Stack Traces** - Analyzes error patterns and implements proper error handling

### Code Quality Issues

- **[TODO Comments](/features/todo-comments)** - Finds TODO items in your codebase and implements the requested functionality
- **Code Bugs** - Uses AI to scan code files and detect potential bugs or performance issues
- **Linear Issues** - Syncs with Linear project management to implement features and fixes

### Integration Support

Tembo connects to your existing tools:

- PostgreSQL databases (including AWS RDS and Supabase)
- GitHub repositories for pull request creation
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Linear for project management

> Tembo focuses on production issues that impact performance and reliability, automatically creating pull requests with the fixes your team needs.

## The Business Impact

Tembo helps engineering teams operate at higher velocity:

### More Output from Your Team

- **Faster execution**: From Slack message to production in minutes, not days
- **Reduced AI lethargy**: Get your entire team on board with AI-assisted development
- **Better resource allocation**: Free up senior engineers to focus on architecture and innovation

### Speed and Consistency

- **Small teams**: Move faster with automation handling the repetitive work
- **Large teams**: Ensure consistency and coverage across all projects and repos
- **All teams**: Adopt AI at the task layer without changing workflows

## What Your Engineers Do

Your team maintains control while Tembo automates the repetitive work:

- **Review & approve**: Merge Tembo's PRs just like any teammate's work
- **Provide feedback**: Give comments and requests; Tembo iterates on changes
- **Focus on what matters**: Build new features, architect systems, solve hard problems
- **Never leave your tools**: Work from Slack, Linear, GitHub — wherever you already are

## Interacting With Tembo

Use Tembo on your terms:

- **Slack:** Get alerts and fixes where your team already lives
- **GitHub:** Review PRs as if they came from a wildly intelligent teammate
- **Web Dashboard:** See what's been fixed, what's coming next, and approve changes

### Solution Review and Approval

While Tembo can work autonomously, you maintain control through your workflow toggle:

1. The agent detects an issue and generates a solution
2. You receive a notification with details and recommendations
3. You can approve, reject, or modify the proposed solution
4. Upon approval, the agent implements the changes
