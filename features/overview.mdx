Tembo is a background coding agent that integrates with your existing development tools to automatically create pull requests that fix bugs, implement features, and improve your codebase.

![How Tembo Works](/images/how-tembo-works.png)

## What Tembo Does

Tembo operates as an engineering agent that works asynchronously in [isolated sandbox environments](/features/sandbox-environment). It monitors your systems, processes assigned tasks, and submits pull requests for your team to review.

Tembo processes tickets from your project management tools ([Linear](/integrations/linear), [Jira](/integrations/jira)), monitors error tracking systems ([Sentry](/integrations/sentry)), analyzes database performance ([PostgreSQL](/integrations/postgres), [Supabase](/integrations/supabase), [AWS RDS](/integrations/aws)), and can be mentioned in [Slack](/integrations/slack) to write code based on your discussions. It generates code to address these issues and submits [pull requests](/features/pull-requests) for review.

## How It Works

Tembo functions through a cycle of detection, execution, and review:

1. **Detection** - Issues are identified through integrations (Sentry errors, database metrics) or manually assigned (Linear/Jira tickets, direct task creation)
2. **Execution** - Tembo analyzes the codebase using your configured [agent](/features/agents) and generates a solution in an isolated environment
3. **Pull Request** - Changes are submitted as a pull request with context about the problem and solution
4. **Feedback Loop** - You can provide feedback by mentioning @tembo in PR comments, and it will iterate on the changes

See [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) for how to refine Tembo's work through natural language feedback in your pull requests.

| **Project Management**       | [Linear](/integrations/linear), [Jira](/integrations/jira), GitHub Issues                     |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | [Sentry](/integrations/sentry)                                                                 |

## Available Agents

| Agent           | Provider         | Default Model       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic        | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Codex**       | OpenAI           | `gpt-5-medium`      |
| **Opencode**    | Anthropic/OpenAI | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Amp**         | Anthropic        | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Cursor**      | Anthropic/OpenAI | `gpt-5-medium`      |

See [Agents](/features/agents) for detailed information on each agent and how to choose the right one for your tasks.

## Configuration

**Rule Files**
You can provide agent-specific instructions through [rule files](/features/rule-files) in your repository. These define coding standards, project conventions, and architectural patterns for Tembo to follow.

**Hooks**
[Hooks](/features/hooks) allow you to execute custom logic before and after Tembo's actions, enabling integration with your existing CI/CD pipelines and workflows.

**MCP Servers**
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](/features/mcp-servers) extend Tembo's capabilities by providing additional tools and context sources that agents can access during task execution.

## Team Workflow

Your team maintains control over what code gets merged:

1. Review pull requests created by Tembo using your standard review process
2. Provide feedback through PR comments (mention @tembo to trigger updates)
3. Approve and merge changes when satisfied with the implementation
4. Configure which issues and signals Tembo responds to through integration settings

Tembo generates solutions autonomously, but your team decides what gets deployed.
