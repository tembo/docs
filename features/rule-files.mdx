After connecting your source control, configure your repository with context that helps Tembo understand your project's conventions, architecture, and requirements.

Tembo automatically looks for configuration files in your repository's root directory. These files provide persistent context that Tembo uses when solving issues and creating pull requests.

## Supported Configuration Files

Tembo supports multiple file names for compatibility with other AI coding agents. Place one of these files in your repository root:

- `tembo.md` (recommended)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.clinerules`
- `.rules`
- `AGENT.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

<Note>
  Tembo will use the first file it finds from this list, so you only need one configuration file per repository.

## Creating Your First Rule File

Create a file named `tembo.md` in your repository root with project context. Here's a minimal example:

```markdown
# Project Context

React + TypeScript frontend with Node.js backend.

## Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, explicit types
- Functional React components with hooks
- Conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

## Structure
- `/src/components` - UI components
- `/src/services` - API and business logic
- `/tests` - Test files
```

Expand sections as needed for your project's complexity.

## What to Include

**Essential:**
- **Build/dev commands** — How to build, test, and run the project
- **Code style** — Naming conventions, formatting rules, standards
- **Testing** — Frameworks, expectations, coverage targets
- **Architecture** — Project structure, design patterns, where code belongs

**Optional but helpful:**
- **Common pitfalls** — Known issues, gotchas to avoid
- **Performance** — Sensitive areas, optimization requirements
- **Security** — Auth patterns, data handling rules
- **Integrations** — External services, API details

## Best Practices

### Keep It Focused

Rule files become part of Tembo's context, so keep them concise and relevant:

- Focus on information that impacts code generation
- Remove outdated or obsolete information
- Use clear, direct language
- Organize with headings for easy scanning

### Use Emphasis for Important Points

Highlight critical information that Tembo should always follow:

```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Always validate user input before database queries
**NOTE**: The API rate limit is 100 requests per minute
**WARNING**: Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
```

### Update Regularly

Keep your rule file current as your project evolves:

- Update when conventions change
- Add new patterns as they emerge
- Remove deprecated guidelines
- Review quarterly to ensure accuracy

## How Tembo Uses Rule Files

When Tembo receives an issue assignment:

1. **Loads the rule file** from your repository root
2. **Includes the content** as part of its context
3. **Follows the guidelines** when generating code
4. **Applies conventions** throughout the solution

The rule file context persists across all interactions, ensuring consistency in every pull request Tembo creates for your repository.

## Next Steps

After configuring your repository:

1. Test it by assigning a small issue to Tembo
2. Review the generated pull request for adherence to your guidelines
3. Refine your rule file based on results
4. Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to iterate on Tembo's work
