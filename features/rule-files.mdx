After connecting your source control, configure your repository with context that helps Tembo understand your project's conventions, architecture, and requirements.

Tembo automatically looks for configuration files in your repository's root directory. These files provide persistent context that Tembo uses when solving issues and creating pull requests.

## Supported Configuration Files

Tembo supports multiple file names for compatibility with other AI coding agents. Place one of these files in your repository root:

- `tembo.md` (recommended)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.clinerules`
- `.rules`
- `AGENT.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

<Note>
  Tembo will use the first file it finds from this list, so you only need one configuration file per repository.

## Creating Your First Rule File

Create a file named `tembo.md` in your repository root and include relevant information about your project. Here's a complete example to get you started:

```markdown
# Project Context

This is a React + TypeScript web application with a Node.js backend API.

## Setup Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (frontend on :3000, backend on :4000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint and fix issues

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Define explicit types, avoid `any`
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use type guards for runtime checks

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Avoid class components
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities

### Formatting
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
- Sort imports alphabetically

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Target >80% code coverage
- Run tests before committing: `npm test`

## Project Structure

- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages` - Page-level components
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/services` - API calls and business logic
- `/src/utils` - Helper functions
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation

## Development Workflow

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Submit pull requests for code review
- Squash commits when merging
- Update documentation when adding features
- Keep changelog up to date

## Architecture Principles

- Separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement error boundaries for React components
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
```

## What to Include

### Essential Information

Include information that helps Tembo make better decisions:

**Build and Development Commands**
Document how to build, test, and run your project. Include any custom scripts or commands specific to your workflow.

**Code Style and Conventions**
Define your coding standards, naming conventions, and formatting rules. This ensures Tembo generates code that matches your project's style.

**Testing Requirements**
Specify your testing expectations, frameworks, and coverage targets. Tembo will write tests that follow your conventions.

**Architecture Guidelines**
Explain your project's structure, design patterns, and architectural decisions. This helps Tembo understand where code belongs.

### Optional But Helpful

**Common Pitfalls**
Document known issues, gotchas, or common mistakes to avoid. This helps Tembo avoid problematic patterns.

**Performance Considerations**
Highlight performance-sensitive areas or optimization requirements specific to your application.

**Security Guidelines**
Specify security requirements, authentication patterns, or data handling rules.

**Integration Details**
Document how your codebase integrates with external services or APIs.

## Best Practices

### Keep It Focused

Rule files become part of Tembo's context, so keep them concise and relevant:

- Focus on information that impacts code generation
- Remove outdated or obsolete information
- Use clear, direct language
- Organize with headings for easy scanning

### Use Emphasis for Important Points

Highlight critical information that Tembo should always follow:

```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Always validate user input before database queries
**NOTE**: The API rate limit is 100 requests per minute
**WARNING**: Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
```

### Update Regularly

Keep your rule file current as your project evolves:

- Update when conventions change
- Add new patterns as they emerge
- Remove deprecated guidelines
- Review quarterly to ensure accuracy

## How Tembo Uses Rule Files

When Tembo receives an issue assignment:

1. **Loads the rule file** from your repository root
2. **Includes the content** as part of its context
3. **Follows the guidelines** when generating code
4. **Applies conventions** throughout the solution

The rule file context persists across all interactions, ensuring consistency in every pull request Tembo creates for your repository.

## Next Steps

After configuring your repository:

1. Test it by assigning a small issue to Tembo
2. Review the generated pull request for adherence to your guidelines
3. Refine your rule file based on results
4. Use the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop) to iterate on Tembo's work
