## Sandbox Types

Tembo supports multiple sandbox environment types to accommodate different use cases and requirements:

### Docker (Default)

The Docker sandbox is the default environment type, offering:

- **Fast startup**: Containers start quickly for rapid task execution
- **Wide compatibility**: Works with most common development workflows
- **Resource efficient**: Lightweight containerization with minimal overhead
- **Best for**: Most general-purpose tasks, web applications, and standard development workflows

### QEMU

The QEMU sandbox provides full virtual machine isolation using QEMU/KVM virtualization:

- **Complete isolation**: Full VM-level isolation for enhanced security
- **System-level access**: Support for tasks requiring deeper system integration
- **Custom kernels**: Ability to run specialized kernel configurations
- **Best for**: Tasks requiring enhanced isolation, system-level operations, or specialized environments

You can configure the sandbox type at the organization, issue, or job level. If not specified, Tembo defaults to the Docker sandbox type.

## Environment Characteristics

### Isolation and Security

The Tembo Sandbox provides strong isolation and security guarantees:

- **Process isolation**: Each task runs in its own isolated environment
- **File system isolation**: Changes are contained within the sandbox
- **Network security**: Controlled network access for security
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints to ensure stability

### Development Workflow Integration

The sandbox environment is designed to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

- **Hook support**: Execute custom commands at different stages via [Tembo Hooks](/features/hooks)
- **Repository access**: Full access to your repository contents and history
- **Build tool compatibility**: Support for common build systems and package managers
- **Testing frameworks**: Compatible with popular testing tools and frameworks
- **Nix dev shell support**: Automatically detects and uses Nix flakes for reproducible development environments

### Nix Development Shells

Tembo's sandbox environment supports Nix flakes for reproducible development environments. To use this feature, your repository must have a `flake.nix` file in the root directory that defines a development shell named `default` for the `x86_64-linux` platform.

**Requirements:**
- Your `flake.nix` must specify `devShells.x86_64-linux.default`
- The development shell must target the x86_64-linux platform (Tembo's sandbox runs on x86_64 Linux)
- The flake must be in your repository's root directory

**Example flake.nix:**
```nix
{
  description = "My project development environment";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    devShells.x86_64-linux.default = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.mkShell {
      packages = with nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux; [
        nodejs
        python3
        # Add any other tools your project needs
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

When configured correctly, Tembo will:
- **Automatically detect** your `flake.nix` file at the repository root
- **Load the default devshell** for the x86_64-linux platform
- **Make available** all packages and environment variables defined in your Nix development shell
- **Ensure reproducibility** across different tasks and environments

**How it works:**
When a coding agent executes commands in the sandbox, it automatically runs them within your Nix development shell if a `flake.nix` is detected. This means all build commands, tests, and scripts will have access to the exact dependencies specified in your flake, ensuring consistent behavior across all task executions.

## Best Practices

- **Leverage pre-installed tools** and pin versions when adding dependencies
- **Minimize installations** and clean up temporary files to optimize resources
- **Be version-aware** when writing build scripts for the multi-language environment
- **Use Nix for complex dependencies**—test locally with `nix develop` and keep flakes minimal

## Support and Updates

The Tembo Sandbox environment is regularly updated to include:

- Security patches for all installed tools
- Updates to major language runtimes and package managers  
- New tools based on community feedback and usage patterns
