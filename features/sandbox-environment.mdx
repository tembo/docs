## Sandbox Types

Tembo supports multiple sandbox environment types to accommodate different use cases and requirements:

### Docker (Default)

The Docker sandbox is the default environment type, offering:

- **Fast startup**: Containers start quickly for rapid task execution
- **Wide compatibility**: Works with most common development workflows
- **Resource efficient**: Lightweight containerization with minimal overhead
- **Best for**: Most general-purpose tasks, web applications, and standard development workflows

### QEMU

The QEMU sandbox provides full virtual machine isolation using QEMU/KVM virtualization:

- **Complete isolation**: Full VM-level isolation for enhanced security
- **System-level access**: Support for tasks requiring deeper system integration
- **Custom kernels**: Ability to run specialized kernel configurations
- **Best for**: Tasks requiring enhanced isolation, system-level operations, or specialized environments

You can configure the sandbox type at the organization, issue, or job level. If not specified, Tembo defaults to the Docker sandbox type.

## Environment Characteristics

### Isolation and Security

The Tembo Sandbox provides strong isolation and security guarantees:

- **Process isolation**: Each task runs in its own isolated environment
- **File system isolation**: Changes are contained within the sandbox
- **Network security**: Controlled network access for security
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints to ensure stability

### Development Workflow Integration

The sandbox environment is designed to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

- **Hook support**: Execute custom commands at different stages via [Tembo Hooks](/features/hooks)
- **Repository access**: Full access to your repository contents and history
- **Build tool compatibility**: Support for common build systems and package managers
- **Testing frameworks**: Compatible with popular testing tools and frameworks
- **Nix dev shell support**: Automatically detects and uses Nix flakes for reproducible development environments

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

Tembo supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI agents to access custom tools, resources, and integrations during task execution. MCP servers can be configured to provide agents with additional capabilities such as:

- **Custom API integrations**: Connect to internal tools and services
- **Database access**: Query and interact with databases directly
- **File system operations**: Extended file manipulation capabilities
- **External data sources**: Access to documentation, wikis, or knowledge bases

To configure MCP servers for your organization, add them to your organization settings in the Tembo dashboard. Agents will automatically have access to configured MCP servers when working on tasks.

### Nix Development Shells

Tembo's sandbox environment supports Nix flakes for reproducible development environments. To use this feature, your repository must have a `flake.nix` file in the root directory that defines a development shell named `default` for the `x86_64-linux` platform.

**Requirements:**
- Your `flake.nix` must specify `devShells.x86_64-linux.default`
- The development shell must target the x86_64-linux platform (Tembo's sandbox runs on x86_64 Linux)
- The flake must be in your repository's root directory

**Example flake.nix:**
```nix
{
  description = "My project development environment";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    devShells.x86_64-linux.default = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.mkShell {
      packages = with nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux; [
        nodejs
        python3
        # Add any other tools your project needs
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

When configured correctly, Tembo will:
- **Automatically detect** your `flake.nix` file at the repository root
- **Load the default devshell** for the x86_64-linux platform
- **Make available** all packages and environment variables defined in your Nix development shell
- **Ensure reproducibility** across different tasks and environments

## Best Practices

When working with the Tembo Sandbox environment:

### Dependency Management

- **Use existing tools**: Leverage the pre-installed package managers and tools when possible
- **Specify versions**: When installing additional dependencies, pin to specific versions for reproducibility
- **Cache efficiently**: Use package manager caching features to improve build times

### Resource Optimization

- **Minimize installations**: Avoid installing large dependencies unless necessary
- **Clean up**: Remove temporary files and build artifacts when possible
- **Use lightweight alternatives**: Choose lighter-weight tools when multiple options are available

### Compatibility Considerations

- **Version awareness**: Be aware of the pre-installed tool versions when writing build scripts
- **Cross-language support**: Take advantage of the multi-language environment for polyglot projects
- **Tool conflicts**: Be mindful of potential conflicts between different language ecosystems

## Support and Updates

The Tembo Sandbox environment is regularly updated to include:

- Security patches for all installed tools
- Updates to major language runtimes and package managers  
- New tools based on community feedback and usage patterns

If you need a specific tool or version that isn't currently available, please reach out to the Tembo team through your dashboard or contact support.
