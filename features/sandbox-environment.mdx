## Environment Characteristics

### Isolation and Security

The Tembo Sandbox operates in a containerized Docker environment that provides:

- **Process isolation**: Each task runs in its own isolated container
- **File system isolation**: Changes are contained within the sandbox
- **Network security**: Controlled network access for security
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints to ensure stability

### Development Workflow Integration

The sandbox environment is designed to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

- **Hook support**: Execute custom commands at different stages via [Tembo Hooks](/features/hooks)
- **Repository access**: Full access to your repository contents and history
- **Build tool compatibility**: Support for common build systems and package managers
- **Testing frameworks**: Compatible with popular testing tools and frameworks
- **Nix dev shell support**: Automatically detects and uses Nix flakes for reproducible development environments

### Nix Development Shells

Tembo's sandbox environment now supports Nix flakes, enabling reproducible development environments for your projects. When working with a repository that contains a `flake.nix` file:

- **Automatic detection**: The sandbox automatically discovers your root `flake.nix` file
- **Package building**: Build and use packages defined in your Nix flake
- **Reproducible environments**: Ensure consistent tooling across different development environments
- **Version management**: Lock dependency versions for predictable builds

This feature is particularly useful for projects that require specific tool versions or have complex dependency requirements that are managed through Nix.

## Best Practices

When working with the Tembo Sandbox environment:

### Dependency Management

- **Use existing tools**: Leverage the pre-installed package managers and tools when possible
- **Specify versions**: When installing additional dependencies, pin to specific versions for reproducibility
- **Cache efficiently**: Use package manager caching features to improve build times

### Resource Optimization

- **Minimize installations**: Avoid installing large dependencies unless necessary
- **Clean up**: Remove temporary files and build artifacts when possible
- **Use lightweight alternatives**: Choose lighter-weight tools when multiple options are available

### Compatibility Considerations

- **Version awareness**: Be aware of the pre-installed tool versions when writing build scripts
- **Cross-language support**: Take advantage of the multi-language environment for polyglot projects
- **Tool conflicts**: Be mindful of potential conflicts between different language ecosystems

## Support and Updates

The Tembo Sandbox environment is regularly updated to include:

- Security patches for all installed tools
- Updates to major language runtimes and package managers  
- New tools based on community feedback and usage patterns

If you need a specific tool or version that isn't currently available, please reach out to the Tembo team through your dashboard or contact support.
