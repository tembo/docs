![How Tembo Works](/images/feedback-loop.png)

Refine, iterate, and improve on Tembo's [pull requests](/features/pull-requests) using natural language feedback directly in your Git provider.

## Prerequisites

The Feedback Loop works automatically once you have:
- [GitHub integration](/integrations/github) or [GitLab integration](/integrations/gitlab) enabled in your Tembo workspace
- At least one pull request or merge request created by Tembo (from error detection, manual assignment, etc.)

That's it! No additional setup required.

<Note>
**Git Provider Support**: The Feedback Loop currently supports GitHub and GitLab. Support for [Bitbucket](/integrations/bitbucket) is coming soon!
</Note>


## How it works

1. **Initial Solution** - Tembo creates a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) to solve an issue
2. **Review & Comment** - You review the PR/MR and leave feedback (tag @tembo in your review or comments)
3. **Automatic Retry** - Tembo processes your feedback and updates the PR/MR with improvements
4. **Iteration** - Continue providing feedback until you're satisfied with the solution

<Note>
**Credit Usage**: Processing feedback through the Feedback Loop consumes credits based on the complexity of the requested changes and the size of the codebase context. Each feedback iteration is treated as a separate task. Learn more about [credit consumption](/admin/billing#what-consumes-credits).
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important**: You must mention `@tembo` in your PR/MR comments or reviews for Tembo to process your feedback. This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or comments meant for other team members.
</Warning>

## Providing Feedback

### Option 1: Use PR/MR Review function

![GitHub Review Interface](/images/request-review.png)

- Submit a formal review using your Git provider's built-in review feature (GitHub PR reviews or GitLab MR reviews)
- Tag "@tembo" in your review summary or in any specific comments you want Tembo to act on (untagged feedback is ignored)
- **Advantages:**
  - Tembo knows exactly which lines you're commenting on for precise fixes
  - You can batch multiple feedback points in a single review
  - Cleaner conversation thread with organized feedback
  - Standard workflow that integrates with your team's process

### Option 2: Add comments
- Leave regular comments in the PR/MR conversation
- You must mention "@tembo" in the comment to trigger processing (untagged comments are ignored)

![Comment Review Example](/images/comment-review.png)

## Example Workflow

> **Scenario:** Tembo creates a PR with a basic try-catch for database timeouts. You review and comment "@tembo add retry logic with exponential backoff, logging, and unit tests." Tembo processes your feedback, pushes a new commit with all changes, and you continue iterating until satisfied.

## What to Expect

**Response Time:**
- Tembo typically acknowledges feedback within 1-2 minutes (👀 reaction)
- Processing and implementing changes usually takes 3-10 minutes depending on complexity
- You'll see new commits appear in the PR once changes are complete

**Processing Indicators:**
- **👀** = Tembo has seen your feedback and is analyzing it
- **🚀** = Tembo is actively working on implementing changes
- **New commits** = Changes are complete and ready for your review

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Feedback

**✅ Be specific and actionable:**
```
@tembo Add input validation for the email field using regex
@tembo Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
```

**❌ Too vague:**
```
@tembo fix the validation
@tembo make it better
```

**✅ Batch feedback in a single review:**
- Add multiple comments to different lines in one review (GitHub PR review or GitLab MR review)
- Tag "@tembo" on the review summary or individual comments you want addressed; Tembo processes all tagged points together for cohesive improvements
- Cleaner conversation thread and better context awareness

**ℹ️ Tagging is required:**
- Tembo only acts on PR/MR feedback that mentions "@tembo" (in reviews or regular comments)
- This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or other bot messages

### What Tembo's Feedback Loop Handles Well

- **Code improvements:** Performance, error handling, refactoring, type safety
- **Testing and documentation:** Unit tests, code comments, README updates  
- **Security and bugs:** Vulnerability fixes, edge cases, error handling
- **Alignment:** Changes that follow your existing code patterns

### Limitations

- Complex architectural changes may need multiple iterations
- Very large-scope changes are better as separate issues
- Works best on code within the current PR scope
