![How Tembo Works](/images/feedback-loop.png)

Refine, iterate, and improve on Tembo's [pull requests](/features/pull-requests) using natural language feedback directly in your Git provider.

## Prerequisites

The Feedback Loop works automatically once you have:
- [GitHub integration](/integrations/github) enabled in your Tembo workspace
- At least one pull request created by Tembo (from error detection, manual assignment, etc.)

That's it! No additional setup required.

<Note>
**Git Provider Support**: The Feedback Loop currently supports GitHub. Support for [GitLab](/integrations/gitlab) and [Bitbucket](/integrations/bitbucket) is coming soon!
</Note>


## How it works

1. **Initial Solution** - Tembo creates a pull request to solve an issue
2. **Review & Comment** - You review the PR and leave feedback (tag @tembo in your GitHub review or comments)
3. **Automatic Retry** - Tembo processes your feedback and updates the PR with improvements
4. **Iteration** - Continue providing feedback until you're satisfied with the solution

<Warning>
**Important**: You must mention `@tembo` in your PR comments or reviews for Tembo to process your feedback. This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or comments meant for other team members.
</Warning>

## Providing Feedback

### Option 1: Use GitHub's PR Review function

![GitHub Review Interface](/images/request-review.png)

- Submit a formal PR review using GitHub's built-in review feature
- Tag "@tembo" in your review summary or in any specific comments you want Tembo to act on (untagged feedback is ignored)
- **Advantages:**
  - Tembo knows exactly which lines you're commenting on for precise fixes
  - You can batch multiple feedback points in a single review
  - Cleaner conversation thread with organized feedback
  - Standard GitHub workflow that integrates with your team's process

### Option 2: Add comments
- Leave regular comments in the PR conversation
- You must mention "@tembo" in the comment to trigger processing (untagged comments are ignored)

## Example Workflow

Here's how a typical feedback loop works in practice:

### Step 1: Tembo Creates Initial PR
Tembo detects a Sentry error about unhandled database timeouts and creates a PR with a basic try-catch solution.

### Step 2: You Provide Feedback via GitHub Review
Using GitHub's review feature, you add multiple comments:
- Line 15: "Add retry logic with exponential backoff"
- Line 22: "Log the timeout duration for monitoring"  
- Line 30: "Consider connection pooling optimization"
- General comment: "Add unit tests for the timeout scenarios"

### Step 3: Tembo Updates the PR
Tembo processes all feedback points together and pushes a new commit that:
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Adds comprehensive logging with timeout metrics
- Optimizes connection pooling configuration
- Includes unit tests covering timeout edge cases

### Step 4: Continue Iterating
If you need further refinements, simply add another review or comment with "@tembo" and the cycle continues.

## What to Expect

**Response Time:**
- Tembo typically acknowledges feedback within 1-2 minutes (üëÄ reaction)
- Processing and implementing changes usually takes 3-10 minutes depending on complexity
- You'll see new commits appear in the PR once changes are complete

**Processing Indicators:**
- **üëÄ** = Tembo has seen your feedback and is analyzing it
- **üöÄ** = Tembo is actively working on implementing changes
- **New commits** = Changes are complete and ready for your review

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Feedback

**‚úÖ Be specific and actionable:**
```
@tembo Add input validation for the email field using regex
@tembo Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
```

**‚ùå Too vague:**
```
@tembo fix the validation
@tembo make it better
```

**‚úÖ Batch feedback in a single review:**
- Add multiple comments to different lines in one GitHub review
- Tag "@tembo" on the review summary or individual comments you want addressed; Tembo processes all tagged points together for cohesive improvements
- Cleaner conversation thread and better context awareness

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tagging is required:**
- Tembo only acts on PR feedback that mentions "@tembo" (in reviews or regular comments)
- This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or other bot messages

### What Tembo's Feedback Loop Handles Well

- **Code improvements:** Performance, error handling, refactoring, type safety
- **Testing and documentation:** Unit tests, code comments, README updates  
- **Security and bugs:** Vulnerability fixes, edge cases, error handling
- **Alignment:** Changes that follow your existing code patterns

### Limitations

- Complex architectural changes may need multiple iterations
- Very large-scope changes are better as separate issues
- Works best on code within the current PR scope
