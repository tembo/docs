![How Tembo Works](/images/feedback-loop.png)

Refine, iterate and improve on Tembo's [pull requests](/features/pull-requests) using natural language feedback directly in your Git provider.

## Prerequisites

The Feedback Loop works automatically once you have:
- [GitHub integration](/integrations/github) enabled in your Tembo workspace
- At least one pull request created by Tembo (from error detection, manual assignment, etc.)

That's it! No additional setup required.


## How it works

1. **Initial Solution** - Tembo creates a pull request to solve an issue
2. **Review & Comment** - You review the PR and leave feedback (via GitHub review or @tembo comments)  
3. **Automatic Retry** - Tembo processes your feedback and updates the PR with improvements
4. **Iteration** - Continue providing feedback until you're satisfied with the solution

## Providing Feedback

### Option 1: Use GitHub's PR Review function

![GitHub Review Interface](/images/request-review.png)

- Submit a formal PR review using GitHub's built-in review feature
- Tembo automatically processes all review feedback - no need to mention "@tembo"
- **Advantages:**
  - Tembo knows exactly which lines you're commenting on for precise fixes
  - You can batch multiple feedback points in a single review
  - Cleaner conversation thread with organized feedback
  - Standard GitHub workflow that integrates with your team's process

### Option 2: Add comments
- Leave regular comments in the PR conversation
- Mention "@tembo" in your comment so Tembo knows to process it

## Example Workflow

Here's how a typical feedback loop works in practice:

### Step 1: Tembo Creates Initial PR
Tembo detects a Sentry error about unhandled database timeouts and creates a PR with a basic try-catch solution.

### Step 2: You Provide Feedback via GitHub Review
Using GitHub's review feature, you add multiple comments:
- Line 15: "Add retry logic with exponential backoff"
- Line 22: "Log the timeout duration for monitoring"  
- Line 30: "Consider connection pooling optimization"
- General comment: "Add unit tests for the timeout scenarios"

### Step 3: Tembo Updates the PR
Tembo processes all feedback points together and pushes a new commit that:
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Adds comprehensive logging with timeout metrics
- Optimizes connection pooling configuration
- Includes unit tests covering timeout edge cases

### Step 4: Continue Iterating
If you need further refinements, simply add another review or comment with "@tembo" and the cycle continues.

## What to Expect

**Response Time:**
- Tembo typically acknowledges feedback within 1-2 minutes (👀 reaction)
- Processing and implementing changes usually takes 3-10 minutes depending on complexity
- You'll see new commits appear in the PR once changes are complete

**Processing Indicators:**
- **👀** = Tembo has seen and is analyzing your feedback
- **🚀** = Tembo is actively working on implementing changes
- **New commits** = Changes are complete and ready for your review

**Batch vs Individual Processing:**
- GitHub reviews: All comments processed together in one batch
- Individual @tembo comments: Processed separately as posted

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Feedback

**✅ Be specific and actionable:**
```
@tembo Add input validation for the email field using regex
@tembo Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
```

**❌ Too vague:**
```
@tembo fix the validation
@tembo make it better
```

**✅ Batch feedback in a single review:**
- Add multiple comments to different lines in one GitHub review
- Tembo processes all points together for cohesive improvements
- Cleaner conversation thread and better context awareness

### What Tembo's Feedback Loop Handles Well

- **Code improvements:** Performance, error handling, refactoring, type safety
- **Testing and documentation:** Unit tests, code comments, README updates  
- **Security and bugs:** Vulnerability fixes, edge cases, error handling
- **Alignment:** Changes that follow your existing code patterns

### Limitations

- Complex architectural changes may need multiple iterations
- Very large-scope changes are better as separate issues
- Works best on code within the current PR scope

## Configuration

**Feedback Loop:** Always active on Tembo-created PRs in GitHub (GitLab support in progress)

**External PR tools:** If you use AI-powered code review tools, enable integration in your [Workspace settings](https://app.tembo.io/settings/organization) and Tembo will respond to these AI reviewers:

- **[Graphite](https://withgraphite.dev/)** - AI-powered code review and workflow optimization
- **[CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/)** - Automated code review with AI-driven insights
- **[Cursor Bug Bot](https://docs.cursor.com/bugbot)** - Intelligent bug detection and code analysis
- **[Diamond](https://diamond.graphite.dev/)** - Advanced code review workflows
