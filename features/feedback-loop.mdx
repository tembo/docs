![How Tembo Works](/images/feedback-loop.png)

Refine, iterate, and improve on Tembo's [pull requests](/features/pull-requests) using natural language feedback directly in your Git provider.

## Prerequisites

The Feedback Loop works automatically once you have:
- [GitHub integration](/integrations/github), [GitLab integration](/integrations/gitlab) or the [BitBucket integration](/integrations/bitbucket) enabled in your Tembo workspace
- At least one pull request or merge request created by Tembo (from error detection, manual assignment, etc.)

That's it! No additional setup required.

## How it works

1. **Initial Solution** - Tembo creates a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) to solve an issue
2. **Review & Comment** - You review the PR/MR and leave feedback (tag @tembo in your review or comments)
3. **Automatic Retry** - Tembo processes your feedback and updates the PR/MR with improvements
4. **Iteration** - Continue providing feedback until you're satisfied with the solution

<Note>
**Credit Usage**: Processing feedback through the Feedback Loop consumes credits based on the complexity of the requested changes and the size of the codebase context. Each feedback iteration is treated as a separate task. Learn more about [credit consumption](/admin/billing#what-consumes-credits).
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important**: You must mention in your PR/MR comments or reviews for Tembo to process your feedback. This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or comments meant for other team members.
In GitHub and Gitlab, this is done by tagging `@tembo` in your comment. In Bitbucket, this is done instead by adding the `/tembo` command.
For the rest of the article, Github will be used as an example.
</Warning>

## Providing Feedback

### Option 1: Use PR/MR Review function

![GitHub Review Interface](/images/request-review.png)

- Submit a formal review using your Git provider's built-in review feature (GitHub PR reviews or GitLab MR reviews)
- Tag "@tembo" in your review summary or in any specific comments you want Tembo to act on (untagged feedback is ignored)
- **Advantages:**
  - Tembo knows exactly which lines you're commenting on for precise fixes
  - You can batch multiple feedback points in a single review
  - Cleaner conversation thread with organized feedback
  - Standard workflow that integrates with your team's process

### Option 2: Add comments
- Leave regular comments in the PR/MR conversation
- You must mention "@tembo" in the comment to trigger processing (untagged comments are ignored)

![Comment Review Example](/images/comment-review.png)

## Example Workflow

> **Scenario:** Tembo creates a PR with a basic try-catch for database timeouts. You review and comment "@tembo add retry logic with exponential backoff, logging, and unit tests." Tembo processes your feedback, pushes a new commit with all changes, and you continue iterating until satisfied.

## What to Expect

**Response Time:**
- Tembo typically acknowledges feedback within 1-2 minutes (👀 reaction)
- Processing and implementing changes usually takes 3-10 minutes depending on complexity
- You'll see new commits appear in the PR once changes are complete

**Processing Indicators:**
- **👀** = Tembo has seen your feedback and is analyzing it
- **🚀** = Tembo is actively working on implementing changes
- **New commits** = Changes are complete and ready for your review

**Slack Notifications:**
- If you created the task from [Slack](/integrations/slack), Tembo will post a notification back to the original Slack thread when your feedback has been processed, including a summary of changes and a link to the updated PR

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** — `@tembo Add retry logic with exponential backoff` beats `@tembo make it better`

**✅ Batch feedback in a single review:**
- Add multiple comments to different lines in one review (GitHub PR review or GitLab MR review)
- Tag "@tembo" on the review summary or individual comments you want addressed; Tembo processes all tagged points together for cohesive improvements
- Cleaner conversation thread and better context awareness

**ℹ️ Tagging is required:**
- Tembo only acts on PR/MR feedback that mentions `@tembo` (or `/tembo` in Bitbucket) (in reviews or regular comments)
- This prevents accidental triggers from internal team discussions or other bot messages

**Works well for:** Code improvements (refactoring, error handling), testing, documentation, security fixes, and changes that follow existing patterns.

**Limitations:** Complex architectural changes may need multiple iterations; large-scope changes are better as separate issues.
