Tembo Automations allow you to build intelligent workflows that run on a schedule or are triggered by events. Instead of waiting for issues to pile up, automations proactively maintain your codebase, generate updates, and respond to events as they happen.

## What Are Automations?

Automations are AI-powered workflows that execute tasks autonomously. They can:

- **React to events**: Respond to GitHub webhooks, Linear issue updates, Sentry errors, or Slack messages
- **Run on schedules**: Execute hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly to perform routine maintenance
- **Access integrations**: Connect to GitHub, Linear, Slack, Sentry, and other tools via [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers)
- **Generate code**: Fix bugs, update dependencies, refactor code, and more using AI coding agents

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Proactive Bug Fixing

Automatically fix issues before they impact users:

- **Sentry Integration**: When an error is detected, Tembo analyzes the stack trace and opens a PR with a fix
- **Failed CI/CD**: Detect failed workflows and push fixes for broken tests or lint errors
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Scan for CVEs and patch dependencies automatically

### 2. Content & Documentation

Keep your documentation and changelogs up to date:

- **Generate Changelogs**: Summarize merged PRs and post updates to Slack or Linear
- **Update Documentation**: Ensure README files and docs stay in sync with code changes
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generate OpenAPI specs from code changes

### 3. Code Quality & Maintenance

Maintain code quality without manual intervention:

- **Clear TODOs**: Find and resolve TODO comments in your codebase
- **Tech Debt Cleanup**: Refactor deprecated patterns or update old dependencies
- **Code Formatting**: Ensure consistent style across the codebase

### 4. Team Communication

Keep your team informed automatically:

- **Daily Standup Summaries**: Post daily progress reports to Slack
- **PR Reminders**: Notify reviewers of pending pull requests
- **Issue Triage**: Label and categorize new issues based on content

## How Automations Work

### Triggers

Automations can be triggered in two ways:

**Schedule-based**: Set a cron schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) for routine tasks.

**Event-based**: React to webhooks from your integrations:
- GitHub: Push events, PR comments, issue updates, workflow failures
- Linear: Issue created, issue updated, issue closed
- Sentry: New error, error spike
- Slack: Messages in specific channels

### Execution

When triggered, automations:

1. **Load context**: Access your repositories and integrations via MCP servers
2. **Run AI agent**: Execute your automation prompt using your chosen [coding agent](/features/coding-agents)
3. **Perform actions**: Create PRs, post to Slack, update issues, or run any task defined in your prompt
4. **Report results**: Track execution logs and outputs in the Tembo dashboard

### MCP Server Access

Automations have access to all your configured [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers), enabling them to:

- Query GitHub repositories, PRs, and issues
- Read and update Linear issues
- Post messages to Slack channels
- Access Sentry error data
- Connect to databases via Postgres MCP
- Use custom MCP servers you've configured

## Creating an Automation

To create an automation:

1. **Navigate to Automations** in the Tembo dashboard
2. **Choose a trigger**: Select schedule-based or event-based
3. **Write your prompt**: Define what the automation should do (see [examples](/automation-examples/overview))
4. **Select coding agent**: Choose which AI agent and model to use
5. **Configure MCP servers**: Select which integrations the automation can access
6. **Test and deploy**: Run a test execution before enabling

## Best Practices

<Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
  Begin with straightforward automations that solve clear problems. Don't try to automate everything at once.
</Card>

<Card title="Use Clear Prompts" icon="pen">
  Your automation prompt should be specific, structured, and include instructions for edge cases.
</Card>

<Card title="Test First" icon="flask">
  Test with a private Slack channel or test repository before enabling for production.
</Card>

<Card title="Schedule Appropriately" icon="clock">
  Choose the right frequency—most information doesn't need minute-by-minute updates.
