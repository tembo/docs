Automations let you run coding agents in the background—on a schedule or triggered by events. Build intelligent workflows that fix bugs, maintain documentation, clear technical debt, and keep your team informed, all without lifting a finger.

## What are Automations?

Automations are the best PRs: the ones that come without you having to think about them.

Instead of manually assigning tasks, automations proactively detect issues and take action. A Sentry error gets fixed within seconds of detection. Documentation stays in sync with your code. Security vulnerabilities get caught and patched before they become problems.

Each automation runs in a secure [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment) with full repository access and your configured [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers).

## Triggers

Automations can run on a schedule or react to events from your integrations.

### Scheduled Triggers

Run automations at regular intervals:

| Schedule | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Hourly** | Monitor for CI failures, new Sentry errors |
| **Daily** | Generate changelogs, post standup summaries |
| **Weekly** | Clean up stale TODOs, security scans, metrics reports |
| **Monthly** | Dependency audits, documentation reviews |

### Event Triggers

React to events from your connected integrations:

| Integration | Events |
|-------------|--------|
| **GitHub** | PR opened, PR merged, issue created, comment added |
| **GitLab** | Merge request opened, merged, issue created |
| **Sentry** | New error, error spike, regression detected |
| **Linear** | Issue created, issue updated, status changed |
| **Slack** | Message in channel, @tembo mention |

<Tip>Event triggers respond in real-time. A Sentry error can have a fix PR opened within seconds of detection.</Tip>

## Creating an Automation

### From a Template

The fastest way to get started:

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click the **Templates** tab
3. Browse available templates and click **Use template**
4. Configure which integration to use (if multiple are connected)
5. Customize the instructions if needed
6. Enable the automation

### From Scratch

For custom workflows:

1. Click **New Automation**
2. Give it a descriptive name
3. Write your instructions using the rich text editor
4. Add triggers (schedule and/or event-based)
5. Select which MCP servers to enable
6. Choose your preferred [coding agent](/features/coding-agents)
7. Save and enable

---

## Configuration Options

### Instructions

Write clear, specific instructions for what the automation should do. You can:

- Use **@mentions** to reference integrations (e.g., @github, @slack, @linear)
- Include formatting with headers, lists, and code blocks
- Reference specific repositories, channels, or projects

See the [prompting guide](/prompting-guide) for best practices.

### Triggers

Add one or more triggers to control when the automation runs:

**Schedule triggers** use cron expressions. Common options:
- Every hour: `0 * * * *`
- Daily at 8 AM: `0 8 * * *`
- Weekly on Monday: `0 9 * * 1`
- Monthly on the 1st: `0 9 1 * *`

**Event triggers** connect to your integrations and fire when specific events occur. You can filter events by repository, project, labels, and more.

### MCP Servers

Enable the [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers) your automation needs. Common combinations:

- **Code changes**: GitHub/GitLab
- **Bug fixes**: GitHub + Sentry
- **Issue triage**: GitHub + Linear
- **Team updates**: GitHub + Slack
- **Full workflow**: GitHub + Linear + Slack + Sentry

### Agent Selection

Choose which [coding agent](/features/coding-agents) runs your automation. Different agents have different strengths—Claude Code excels at complex reasoning, while others may be faster for simpler tasks.

## Example Automations

| Automation | Trigger | MCP Servers | What it does |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [**PR Descriptions**](https://tembo.io/for/pr-description-enhancement) | PR opened | GitHub | Summarizes diff, lists changes, notes breaking changes, adds testing instructions |
| [**Bug Triage**](https://tembo.io/for/bug-triage) | Daily 8 AM | Sentry, Slack, Linear | Ranks errors by users affected, posts top 3 to Slack, creates Linear tickets |
| [**PR Reviews**](https://tembo.io/for/pr-reviews) | PR opened | GitHub | Reviews for bugs, security, performance, style; leaves inline comments |
| [**Security Scan**](https://tembo.io/for/code-scanning) | Daily | GitHub, Linear | Scans for SQL injection, XSS, secrets, auth flaws; creates tickets with severity |
| [**Issue Enrichment**](https://tembo.io/for/ticket-planning) | Linear issue created | Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion | Searches codebase, finds Slack threads, pulls Notion docs, adds implementation hints |

## Managing Automations

### Run History

Each automation tracks its run history. View:
- When it last ran
- Success/failure status
- PRs created
- Messages posted

### Pausing and Archiving

- **Pause** an automation to temporarily stop it from running
- **Archive** automations you no longer need (can be restored later)

### Editing Live Automations

Changes to automations take effect on the next run. Running automations complete with their original instructions.

## Best Practices

- **Start simple** — Begin with one automation that solves a clear problem before adding complexity
- **Use templates** — Customize battle-tested starting points rather than building from scratch
- **Be specific** — Tell the automation exactly what to do, where to post, and how to format output
- **Test first** — Use a test repository or Slack channel before switching to production targets
- **Monitor results** — Check run history regularly and adjust instructions as needed
