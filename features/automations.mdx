**Automations in Tembo allow you to offload repetitive engineering work to background coding agents.** Set up workflows that run on a schedule or trigger from events in your stack—like new Sentry errors, Linear issues, or Slack messages.

## What are Automations?

Automations are intelligent workflows that combine:

- **Triggers** - Schedule-based (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) or event-based (GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Slack)
- **Coding Agents** - Any [supported coding agent](/features/coding-agents) with your preferred model
- **Context** - Full access to your repositories and [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers)
- **Actions** - Generate code, create PRs, post to Slack, update docs

Unlike CI/CD scripts, automations use AI agents to analyze context, make decisions, and write code autonomously.

## Common Use Cases

**Fix Production Bugs** - Monitor Sentry errors and automatically generate PRs to fix issues.

**Generate Changelogs** - Create customer-facing changelogs from merged pull requests.

**Reduce Technical Debt** - Periodic analysis to identify and fix TODOs, code smells, and quick wins.

**Keep Docs in Sync** - Automatically update documentation when API changes are merged.

## How It Works

1. **Configure the Trigger** - Choose when your automation runs (schedule or event)
2. **Write the Prompt** - Describe what you want the automation to do
3. **Select Agent & Model** - Choose which [coding agent](/features/coding-agents) to use
4. **Add MCP Servers** - Connect to services via [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers)
5. **Test & Enable** - Run a test execution, then enable for production

Each automation runs in an isolated [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment).

## Creating an Automation

Navigate to [Automations](https://app.tembo.io/automations) and click "Create Automation" to configure:

- **Name & Trigger** - Description and when it runs
- **Prompt** - Instructions for the automation
- **Agent** - Which coding agent to use
- **Repositories** - Which repos to access
- **MCP Servers** - Additional tools and integrations

<Tip>Start with simple scheduled automations before moving to event-based triggers.</Tip>
