Automations let you run coding agents in the background—on a schedule or triggered by events. Build intelligent workflows that fix bugs, maintain documentation, clear technical debt, and keep your team informed, all without lifting a finger.

## What are Automations?

Automations are the best PRs: the ones that come without you having to think about them.

Instead of manually assigning tasks, automations proactively detect issues and take action. A Sentry error gets fixed within seconds of detection. Documentation stays in sync with your code. Security vulnerabilities get caught and patched before they become problems.

Each automation runs in a secure [sandbox environment](/features/sandbox-environment) with full repository access and your configured [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers).

---

## Triggers

Automations can run on a schedule or react to events from your integrations.

### Scheduled Triggers

Run automations at regular intervals:

| Schedule | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Hourly** | Monitor for CI failures, new Sentry errors |
| **Daily** | Generate changelogs, post standup summaries |
| **Weekly** | Clean up stale TODOs, security scans, metrics reports |
| **Monthly** | Dependency audits, documentation reviews |

### Event Triggers

React to events from your connected integrations:

| Integration | Events |
|-------------|--------|
| **GitHub** | PR opened, PR merged, issue created, comment added |
| **GitLab** | Merge request opened, merged, issue created |
| **Bitbucket** | PR opened, PR updated, PR merged, PR comment added |
| **Sentry** | New error, error spike, regression detected |
| **Linear** | Issue created, issue updated, status changed |
| **Slack** | Message in channel, @tembo mention |

<Tip>Event triggers respond in real-time. A Sentry error can have a fix PR opened within seconds of detection.</Tip>

## Creating an Automation

### From a Template

The fastest way to get started:

1. Navigate to **Automations** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click the **Templates** tab
3. Browse available templates and click **Use template**
4. Configure which integration to use (if multiple are connected)
5. Customize the instructions if needed
6. Enable the automation

### From Scratch

For custom workflows:

1. Click **New Automation**
2. Give it a descriptive name
3. Write your instructions using the rich text editor
4. Add triggers (schedule and/or event-based)
5. Select which MCP servers to enable
6. Choose your preferred [coding agent](/features/coding-agents)
7. Save and enable

---

## Configuration Options

### Instructions

Write clear, specific instructions for what the automation should do. You can:

- Use **@mentions** to reference integrations (e.g., @github, @slack, @linear)
- Include formatting with headers, lists, and code blocks
- Reference specific repositories, channels, or projects

See the [prompting guide](/prompting-guide) for best practices.

### Triggers

Add one or more triggers to control when the automation runs:

**Schedule triggers** use cron expressions. Common options:
- Every hour: `0 * * * *`
- Daily at 8 AM: `0 8 * * *`
- Weekly on Monday: `0 9 * * 1`
- Monthly on the 1st: `0 9 1 * *`

**Event triggers** connect to your integrations and fire when specific events occur. You can filter events by repository, project, labels, and more.

### MCP Servers

Enable the [MCP servers](/features/mcp-servers) your automation needs. Common combinations:

- **Code changes**: GitHub/GitLab
- **Bug fixes**: GitHub + Sentry
- **Issue triage**: GitHub + Linear
- **Team updates**: GitHub + Slack
- **Full workflow**: GitHub + Linear + Slack + Sentry

### Agent Selection

Choose which [coding agent](/features/coding-agents) runs your automation. Different agents have different strengths—Claude Code excels at complex reasoning, while others may be faster for simpler tasks.

## Example Automations

### Auto-Generate PR Descriptions

Automatically create clear, well-formatted PR descriptions when PRs are opened.

**Trigger**: PR opened
**MCP Servers**: GitHub

```text
When a PR is opened, analyze the diff and generate a description:
1. Summarize what changed and why
2. List key modifications
3. Note any breaking changes
4. Add testing instructions
```

---

### Prioritize Sentry Errors

Get a daily report of the most impactful bugs, ranked by users affected.

**Trigger**: Daily at 8 AM
**MCP Servers**: Sentry, Slack, Linear

```text
Every morning:
1. Fetch errors from the last 24 hours
2. Rank by number of affected users
3. Post top 3 to #engineering-bugs
4. Create Linear tickets for each
```

---

### Automated PR Reviews

Get instant code reviews on every pull request.

**Trigger**: PR opened/updated
**MCP Servers**: GitHub

```text
Review this PR for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Style guide compliance

Leave inline comments on specific lines.
Auto-approve if no issues found.
```

[Use this template →](https://tembo.io/for/pr-reviews)

---

### Security Vulnerability Scan

Scan your codebase daily for security issues.

**Trigger**: Daily
**MCP Servers**: GitHub, Linear

```text
Scan for:
- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets
- Authentication flaws

Create Linear tickets for each finding with severity ratings.
Generate fix PRs for critical issues.
```

[Use this template →](https://tembo.io/for/code-scanning)

---

### Enrich Linear Issues

Automatically add context to new Linear issues from your codebase, Slack, and docs.

**Trigger**: Linear issue created
**MCP Servers**: Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion

```text
When a new issue is created:
1. Search codebase for relevant files
2. Find related Slack conversations
3. Pull in Notion documentation
4. Add a comment with implementation hints
```

## Managing Automations

### Run History

Each automation tracks its run history. View:
- When it last ran
- Success/failure status
- PRs created
- Messages posted

### Pausing and Archiving

- **Pause** an automation to temporarily stop it from running
- **Archive** automations you no longer need (can be restored later)

### Editing Live Automations

Changes to automations take effect on the next run. Running automations complete with their original instructions.

## Best Practices

- **Start simple** — Begin with one automation that solves a clear problem before adding complexity
- **Use templates** — Customize battle-tested starting points rather than building from scratch
- **Be specific** — Tell the automation exactly what to do, where to post, and how to format output
- **Test first** — Use a test repository or Slack channel before switching to production targets
- **Monitor results** — Check run history regularly and adjust instructions as needed
