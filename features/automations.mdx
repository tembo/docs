Automations allow you to run background coding agents on a schedule or triggered by events. Build intelligent workflows that keep your codebase healthy, documentation up-to-date, and team informed—automatically.

## What are Automations?

Automations are scheduled or event-driven tasks that run coding agents in the background. Unlike manual task assignment, automations proactively detect issues and take action without human intervention.

**Common use cases:**
- Maintain documentation by syncing docs with monorepo changes
- Clear technical debt by fixing TODOs and security issues
- Generate changelogs from merged PRs
- React to Sentry errors or failed CI workflows
- Post daily standup summaries or weekly reports

## How It Works

1. **Trigger** - Run on schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) or in response to events
2. **Execute** - Coding agent runs with full repository access and [MCP server](/features/mcp-servers) integrations
3. **Output** - Create PRs, post to Slack, update issues, or trigger other workflows

## Creating an Automation

Navigate to Automations in your Tembo dashboard and configure:

- **Prompt** — Clear instructions for what to do (see [prompting guide](/prompting-guide))
- **Schedule** — When it runs: hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly
- **Coding Agent** — Which [agent and model](/features/coding-agents) to use
- **MCP Servers** — Enable needed integrations (GitHub, Slack, Linear, Sentry, etc.)

## Example Automations

**Daily Changelog:** Find merged PRs from last 24 hours, categorize by type, and post formatted summary to #changelog.

**Weekly TODO Cleanup:** Find TODOs older than 30 days, create Linear issues with context, and open PR removing them.
