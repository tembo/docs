Tembo automatically creates a pull request when its work is complete. You can trigger its work automatically through integrations like [Sentry](/integrations/sentry) or database monitoring, or through manual assignment with a ticket in [Linear](/integrations/linear).

## How It Works

1. **Issue Triggered** - Either automatically detected from Sentry/database monitoring, or manually assigned via Linear issues
2. **Generates Solution** - Analyzes your codebase and creates appropriate fixes
3. **Creates PR** - Submits with clear descriptions and context
4. **You Review** - Standard GitHub workflow with [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## What Triggers Tembo PRs

### Automatic Detection

- **Sentry errors** and application crashes
- **Database performance issues** like slow queries or missing indexes
- **Code quality problems** detected through analysis

### Manual Assignment

#### Direct Requests

Create tasks directly through the Tembo dashboard for specific improvements.

- **Single repository**: Select a specific repository from the dropdown, or use **Auto detect** to have Tembo automatically identify the most appropriate repository for your task using AI
- **Multiple repositories**: Select multiple repositories from the dropdown when your task spans across different codebases (e.g., frontend and backend changes)

#### Linear Issues

Assign [Linear](/integrations/linear) issues to Tembo for interactive repository selection.

- **Assign the issue** - Assign the Linear issue directly to Tembo
- **Select repository** - Tembo will prompt you with a dropdown menu to select which repository to work on
- **Multiple repositories** - Type multiple repository names when prompted to work across several repositories simultaneously
- **Default repository** - Optionally configure a default repository in Tembo settings to streamline the selection process

#### Jira Issues

Assign [Jira](/integrations/jira) issues to Tembo with appropriate labels or assignments.

*Note: Repository detection and multi-repository tasks are not yet supported for Jira integration. Tembo will use your default repository setting.*

#### Github Issues

Mention Tembo with some request in a [Github](/integrations/github) issue and Tembo will start working on it.

## Tembo's Pull Requests

Tembo's pull requests are created with the following characteristics:

- **Clear descriptions** of the problem and solution approach
- **Focused changes** that follow your coding standards through [Rule Files](/features/rule-files)
- **Context links** to original errors, issues, or performance metrics
- **Tests** when appropriate for the change type

### AI-Generated Commit Messages

Tembo automatically generates meaningful commit messages for all changes it makes. Each commit message:

- **Summarizes the changes** in a concise, descriptive format
- **Reflects the context** from the original issue or task
- **Follows best practices** for commit message structure
- **Incorporates feedback** when you request changes through the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

The AI analyzes the git diff and issue context to create commit messages that accurately describe what was changed and why, making it easier to understand the commit history at a glance.

### PR Template Support

When creating a pull request, Tembo reads your repository's PR template and uses it to structure the PR description according to your preferred format. If no template is found, Tembo generates a standard PR description.

Tembo checks for PR templates in the following locations:
- `/.github/pull_request_template.md` or `/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `/docs/pull_request_template.md` or `/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `/pull_request_template.md` or `/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (root directory)

This ensures that Tembo's pull requests maintain consistency with your team's existing PR conventions and required sections.
