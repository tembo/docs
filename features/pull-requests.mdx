Tembo automatically creates a pull request when its work is complete. You can trigger its work automatically through integrations like [Sentry](/integrations/sentry) or database monitoring, or through manual assignment with a ticket in [Linear](/integrations/linear).

## How It Works

1. **Issue Triggered** - Either automatically detected from Sentry/database monitoring, or manually assigned via Linear issues
2. **Generates Solution** - Analyzes your codebase and creates appropriate fixes
3. **Creates PR** - Submits with clear descriptions and context
4. **You Review** - Standard GitHub workflow with [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## What Triggers Tembo PRs

### Automatic Detection

- **Sentry errors** and application crashes
- **Database performance issues** like slow queries or missing indexes
- **Code quality problems** detected through analysis

### Manual Assignment

#### Direct Requests

Create tasks directly through the Tembo dashboard for specific improvements.

- **Single repository**: Select a specific repository from the dropdown, or use **Auto detect** to have Tembo automatically identify the most appropriate repository for your task using AI
- **Multiple repositories**: Select multiple repositories from the dropdown when your task spans across different codebases (e.g., frontend and backend changes)

#### Linear Issues

Assign [Linear](/integrations/linear) issues to Tembo for interactive repository selection.

- **Assign the issue** - Assign the Linear issue directly to Tembo
- **Select repository** - Tembo will prompt you with a dropdown menu to select which repository to work on
- **Multiple repositories** - Type multiple repository names when prompted to work across several repositories simultaneously
- **Default repository** - Optionally configure a default repository in Tembo settings to streamline the selection process

#### Jira Issues

Label [Jira](/integrations/jira) issues with "Tembo" to trigger analysis. Use `tembo/{repo-name}` labels (e.g., `tembo/frontend`) to target specific repositories.

#### Github Issues

Mention Tembo with some request in a [Github](/integrations/github) issue and Tembo will start working on it.

## Tembo's Pull Requests

Tembo's pull requests are created with the following characteristics:

- **Clear descriptions** of the problem and solution approach
- **Focused changes** that follow your coding standards through [Rule Files](/features/rule-files)
- **Context links** to original errors, issues, or performance metrics
- **Tests** when appropriate for the change type

### AI-Generated Commit Messages

Tembo automatically generates meaningful commit messages for all changes it makes. Each commit message:

- **Summarizes the changes** in a concise, descriptive format
- **Reflects the context** from the original issue or task
- **Follows best practices** for commit message structure
- **Incorporates feedback** when you request changes through the [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

The AI analyzes the git diff and issue context to create commit messages that accurately describe what was changed and why, making it easier to understand the commit history at a glance.

### Signed Commits

For GitHub integrations, Tembo automatically signs all commits using the GitHub App. This results in "Verified" badges on your commits, providing assurance that the code was generated by Tembo's authenticated integration.

### PR Template Support

When creating a pull request, Tembo reads your repository's PR template and uses it to structure the PR description according to your preferred format. If no template is found, Tembo generates a standard PR description.

Tembo checks for PR templates in the following locations:
- `/.github/pull_request_template.md` or `/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `/docs/pull_request_template.md` or `/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `/pull_request_template.md` or `/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (root directory)

This ensures that Tembo's pull requests maintain consistency with your team's existing PR conventions and required sections.

## Troubleshooting

### Pull Request Not Created

If Tembo isn't creating pull requests for your tasks:

1. **Verify repository activation** - Ensure the repository is active in your Tembo dashboard under Integrations
2. **Check branch permissions** - Confirm Tembo has permission to create branches in your repository
3. **Review integration status** - Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) to verify your Git provider integration is connected
4. **Check for existing PRs** - Tembo may skip creating duplicate PRs for the same issue

### PR Description Missing Context

If pull request descriptions lack sufficient detail:

1. **Improve task descriptions** - Provide clear, detailed task descriptions with context about the problem and expected solution
2. **Add PR templates** - Create a PR template in your repository to guide Tembo's PR descriptions
3. **Use rule files** - Add a [rule file](/features/rule-files) with PR guidelines and formatting preferences

### Commits Not Signed (GitHub)

If commits appear without the "Verified" badge:

1. **Reinstall the GitHub App** - Disconnect and reconnect the GitHub integration from the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations)
2. **Check repository permissions** - Ensure the Tembo GitHub App has write access to the repository
3. **Verify organization settings** - Some organizations require additional approval for GitHub App installations
