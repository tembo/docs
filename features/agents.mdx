Tembo supports agents to solve your software engineering tasks. Each agent has different capabilities, models, and configuration options.

## Available Agents

| Agent           | Provider         | Default Model       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic        | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Codex**       | OpenAI           | `gpt-5-medium`      |
| **Opencode**    | Anthropic/OpenAI | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Amp**         | Anthropic        | `claude-4-5-sonnet` |
| **Cursor**      | Anthropic/OpenAI | `gpt-5-medium`      |

### Claude Code (Default)

Claude Code is Tembo's default agent, powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Codex

Codex is an agent powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-5 models with varying reasoning levels, allowing you to choose the right balance of speed and thoroughness.

**Supported Models:**

- `gpt-5-medium` (Default) - Balanced reasoning
- `gpt-5-minimal` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `gpt-5-low` - Quick reasoning
- `gpt-5-high` - Deep reasoning for complex problems

### Opencode

Opencode is an alternative agent supporting both Anthropic Claude models and OpenAI GPT models, providing flexibility in model selection.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4-5-haiku` - Fastest, lightweight reasoning
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `claude-4-sonnet` - Fast and efficient

### Amp

Amp is a powerful AI coding agent powered by Anthropic's Claude models.

Amp uses smart model detection and currently uses [Sonnet 4.5](https://ampcode.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) as its main model.

### Cursor

Cursor is an AI coding agent supporting both Anthropic Claude models and OpenAI GPT models through the Cursor CLI.

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-4-5-sonnet` - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-4.1-opus` - Maximum capability for complex tasks
- `gpt-5` - Powerful reasoning and code generation
- `composer-1` - OpenAI's composer model

## Selecting an Agent

Agents are specified using an agent key format: `agentType:model`

**Examples:**

- `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `codex:gpt-5-medium`
- `opencode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `amp:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `cursor:gpt-5`

If no agent is specified, Tembo defaults to `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`.

## Using Rule Files

Rule files allow you to provide agent-specific instructions and coding standards. Each agent reads from its designated configuration file in your repository root (see **Rule File** listed above for each agent).

These files can include:

- Coding standards and style guidelines
- Project-specific conventions
- Commands to run before or after certain operations
- Context about your architecture and patterns

Learn more about [rule files](/features/rule-files).

## Switching Between Agents

You can configure which agent to use for your organization or specific tasks through:

1. **Dashboard Settings** - Set a default agent for all tasks
2. **API Configuration** - Specify an agent key when creating tasks via API
3. **Integration Settings** - Configure per-integration agent preferences

Contact your Tembo administrator or check the [API documentation](/api-reference) for details on agent configuration.
