Tembo supports agents to solve your software engineering tasks. Each agent has different capabilities, models, and configuration options.

## Available Agents

### Claude Code (Default)

Claude Code is Tembo's default agent, powered by Anthropic's Claude models. It provides the most reliable and battle-tested experience for solving software engineering tasks.

**Supported Models:**
- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default)
- `claude-4.1-opus`
- `claude-4-sonnet`
- `claude-3-7-sonnet`

### Codex

Codex is an agent powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-5 models with varying reasoning levels.

**Supported Models:**
- `gpt-5-medium` (Default)
- `gpt-5-minimal`
- `gpt-5-low`
- `gpt-5-high`

### Opencode

Opencode is an alternative agent supporting both Anthropic Claude models and OpenAI GPT models.

**Supported Models:**
- `claude-4-5-sonnet` (Default)
- `claude-4.1-opus`
- `claude-4-sonnet`
- `claude-3-7-sonnet`

### Amp

Amp is a powerful AI coding agent powered by Anthropic's Claude models, designed for interactive development workflows. Amp uses smart model detection and currently uses [Sonnet 4.5](https://ampcode.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) as its main model.

## Selecting an Agent

Agents are specified using an agent key format: `agentType:model`

**Examples:**
- `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `codex:gpt-5-medium`
- `opencode:claude-4-5-sonnet`
- `amp:claude-4-5-sonnet`

If no agent is specified, Tembo defaults to `claudeCode:claude-4-5-sonnet`.

## Configuration Files

Each agent can read configuration from rule files in your repository:

- **Claude Code** looks for `CLAUDE.md` or `claude.md`
- **Codex** looks for `AGENTS.md` or `agents.md`
- **Opencode** looks for `AGENTS.md` or `agents.md`
- **Amp** looks for `AGENTS.md` or `AGENT.md`

These files allow you to provide agent-specific instructions and coding standards. Learn more about [rule files](/features/rule-files).

## Switching Between Agents

You can configure which agent to use for your organization or specific tasks through:

1. **Dashboard Settings** - Set a default agent for all tasks
2. **API Configuration** - Specify an agent key when creating tasks via API
3. **Integration Settings** - Configure per-integration agent preferences

Contact your Tembo administrator or check the [API documentation](/api-reference) for details on agent configuration.
