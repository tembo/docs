Over the past month, we focused on features that make Tembo faster to use in your day‑to‑day workflow and easier to fit into your existing toolchain. Here are the top customer‑facing updates.

## Slack integration

Assign tasks and receive pull requests directly from Slack. Create, track, and review without leaving your channel.

- Turn messages into tasks with a click
- Get PR links and status updates in‑thread
- Reduce context switching across tools

## Multi‑agent support

Choose the coding agent that fits your team. Tembo now supports multiple agents, including Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex — with more coming soon. We’ve also added support for the latest Claude 4.5 Sonnet model for stronger code understanding and generation.

- Switch agents per task or workspace
- Configure defaults in Settings
- Mix and match based on repo or task type

## Refreshed design

The dashboard and key pages got a polish pass for clarity, speed, and consistency. It’s faster to find what you need and easier to follow what Tembo is doing.

Updates include improved navigation, clearer hierarchy, and more consistent interactions across the app.

## Faster PR feedback loops

We reduced round‑trip time for PR comments and status changes. Reviews feel snappier, and Tembo responds more quickly to your inputs.

## Comment tagging for precision

To keep conversations clean, Tembo now only reacts when explicitly tagged. Mention `@tembo` in a PR comment when you want action — and avoid replies on internal threads or other bots.

## Public API and SDK

Automate Tembo from your systems with the Public API and SDK.

- Create and manage tasks programmatically
- Monitor status and pull logs
- Tie Tembo into CI/CD or internal tools

Explore the API in the sidebar under Public API, or start from the [dashboard](https://app.tembo.io).
