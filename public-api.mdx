---

Tembo's Public API is available at [api.tembo.io](https://api.tembo.io) and provides programmatic access to Tembo's functionality. API keys provide a secure way to authenticate with Tembo's API endpoints, allowing you to interact with Tembo from external applications, scripts, or integrations.


## Creating API Keys

### Through the Web Interface

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys** in your Tembo dashboard
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Copy the generated API key immediately - it won't be shown again for security reasons
4. Store the API key securely in your application or password manager

<Warning>
  API keys are only displayed once after creation. Make sure to copy and store
  them securely before closing the creation dialog.
</Warning>

### Key Limits

Each organization can have up to **10 active API keys** at a time. If you need more, contact support.

## Using API Keys

### Quick Start with TypeScript

Here's a complete example of creating a task using TypeScript:

```typescript
const TEMBO_API_KEY = process.env.TEMBO_API_KEY

const response = await fetch("https://api.tembo.io/task/create", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${TEMBO_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    description: "Fix authentication bug in login flow",
    queueRightAway: true,
    codeRepoIds: ["repo-abc123"],
    branch: "main",
    agent: "claudeCode:claude-4-sonnet",
  }),
})
```

### Authentication Methods

You can authenticate API requests using your API key in two ways:

#### Bearer Token (Recommended)

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  https://api.tembo.io/task/list
```

#### Query Parameter

Pass the API key as a query parameter:

```bash
curl "https://api.tembo.io/task/list?apiKey=your_api_key_here"
```

<Note>
  The Bearer token method is recommended as it's more secure - query parameters
  can be logged in server access logs.
</Note>

## Available API Endpoints

For a complete list of available API endpoints, visit [api.tembo.io](https://api.tembo.io).

## Creating Tasks via API

Here's how to create a new task using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tembo.io/task/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Fix the login bug in user authentication",
    "json": "{\"priority\": \"high\", \"type\": \"bug\"}",
    "queueRightAway": true,
    "codeRepoIds": ["repo-id-1", "repo-id-2"],
    "branch": "main"
  }'
```

### Request Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A clear description of the task
- `json` (string, required): Additional task metadata in JSON format
- `queueRightAway` (boolean, optional): Whether to queue the task immediately (default: false)
- `codeRepoIds` (array, optional): Array of repository IDs to associate with the task
- `branch` (string, optional): Target branch for the task

## Listing Tasks

Retrieve a paginated list of tasks for your organization:

```bash
curl "https://api.tembo.io/task/list?limit=20&page=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

### Query Parameters

- `limit` (number, optional): Number of tasks per page (1-100, default: 10)
- `page` (number, optional): Page number (default: 1)

## Searching Tasks

Search for tasks by title or description:

```bash
curl "https://api.tembo.io/task/search?q=authentication&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

### Query Parameters

- `q` (string, required): Search query to match against task titles and descriptions
- `limit` (number, optional): Number of results per page (1-100, default: 10)
- `page` (number, optional): Page number (default: 1)

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Active Keys

In the Tembo dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API Keys** to see:

- All active API keys for your organization
- Creation dates for each key
- Truncated key values (first and last 8 characters)
- Key status (Active/Revoked)

### Revoking API Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the trash icon next to the key
4. Confirm the revocation

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key is immediate and irreversible. Any applications using the
  revoked key will stop working immediately.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

### Storage

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** to store API keys in applications
- **Use secure credential management** systems in production environments

### Rotation

- **Rotate API keys regularly** as part of your security practices
- **Create new keys** before revoking old ones to prevent service interruptions
- **Audit key usage** periodically to ensure only necessary keys are active

### Access Control

- **Use separate keys** for different applications or environments
- **Revoke unused keys** immediately
- **Monitor API key usage** through your application logs


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized**

- Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked
- Ensure you're using the correct authentication method
- Check that your organization has access to the API

**400 Bad Request**

- Validate your request payload matches the expected format
- Ensure required fields are included
- Check that JSON is properly formatted

**Rate Limiting**

- API keys may be subject to rate limiting
- Implement exponential backoff in your applications
- Contact support if you need higher rate limits

### Getting Help

If you're having trouble with API keys:

1. Check the Tembo dashboard to verify your key is active
2. Review the API endpoint documentation
3. Contact support at [hi@tembo.io](mailto:hi@tembo.io)
